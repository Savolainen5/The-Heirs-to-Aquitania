To Do, v0.36

Events:

- Russia and Smolensk go at it, with Poland helping one or the other
- Springtime of Nations should hit Roman Empire harder?
	- Remove cores from GRE and ANA when they're released as vassals so impatient players can't just release and annex them
- Revisit that ability of German states to not attend the Brunswick congress - AI will currently always attend
- French popular radicalism in Paris that begins uniting. Not really necessary now that France is buffed. Pan-Nationalists are strong, too
- Event/Decision to try to mediate Germany?
- Danubian Federation-thing for Roman Empire
- Massive problem for the Roman Empire if they fail to take Rome, or if they lose it.
- Small event chain to change Wallonia into some other country which accepts Picard (or to separate Wallonia and Picardy)
- What happens with the Hungarian event chain if Bohemia becomes a democracy?
- Make CBs for war events work so that there's a more elegant solution than reducing infamy
- Teralarga ideas: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-18#post-21233954
- French-speaking POPs appeal to united France to help them with Persia, end up partitioning Persia
- Unequal Treaty events for Nanyue, tweak it for Qin
- Some kind of country/nationalism for Solelha in Florida
- Qin civil war of some kind?
- Dissolution of Maghreb
- Tweak Bavarian choices for Brunswick Congress so they're better

Decisions:

- Add decision for ZAC to claim Lusatia and Ruthenia
- France takes back Challans (La Roche, 437) from AQT
- Japan claims Ainu Mosir and the northern islands (the latter decision exists already and has merely been disabled)
- AQT decision reclaim SA colonies if they're lost
- Decisions for Roman Empire to conquer Levant, Italy, restore Imperial Borders
	- Move capital back to Rome and assimilate/accept lots
	- Roman Empire can reconquer Rome and get Italian and Sicilian added as accepted, and/or assimilation
	- See the ideas from Crushric https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-11
	- Event/decision for, when it has conquered all of Armenia (make this easier?), crack down on Armenians or risk wrath of military?
- Imperial ambitions for Georgia
- Deal with UBD formation, if it makes sense even - Finland will do it if it has no brigades, maybe

- Greece rejoins a democratic Roman Empire?
- Portugal claims Atlantic islands
- Update gtfo_HtA with new tags
- check NationalUnification to see if the Arab Union needs to have the relevant culture group excluded in order to be able to form
- A union of Margaria and Vestland

POPs:

- Craftsmen in Europe (which is less industrialised than vanilla)
- Readd Mahayana in China, since all Mahayana were changed to Confucian
- Increase POPs in the super-low-POP countries like SKM, MDT, YKT, KZH, YUC
- Reduce POPs in Vestland, Margaria, Hoyekysten because there aren't a lot of Scandinavians to migrate to these countries
- Orthodox minorities in the Middle East, Armenian heartland, see http://i.imgur.com/7uVsYh4.png
- Adjust POPs in USR - Fewer in the south (as in Brazil today), more in the north around the capital, more Guarani in Paraguay/Brazil
- Remove Andean POPs from the southern part of Inca?
- Boost POPs of Uganda and Rwanda regions which have had their province size increased?
- Add some Turkmen folks (maybe minorities) in Syria
- Change the French in the Holy Land to Outremer or Levantine or whatever
- Add more Jews throughout Europe!
- Add more minorities in Europe on the other side of orders

Militaries:
- Navies for much of the world
- Central American countries
- Uilscyr, after POP adjustment

Localisation:
- In general, modify non-HtA events so they fit the world as is.
- Parties for Wallonia, Brabant, lots more
- Finish renaming provinces and regions in Australia, New Zealand
- Rename sea provinces as needed around the world, especially in the New World
- Rewrite Death of Emperor Iesada event to reflect the situation on the ground

Map:
- Trade ports in Japan for Naples, Alba and/or others? Added a small port in v0.31 for Netherlands
- Mess with the Argentinian Andes. Maybe give Lonca more control over them. That way, Argentina doesn't so easily get a crazy snaky shape up into Inca
- Mess with overall region/province shapes in Africa so they're less OTL-y
- Do some province reshaping and add another province in the border region between AQT and NAV
- Make provinces conform better to new RDS rivers. Especially Khiva-Persia

Flags: More about this can be found in the "List of small things to be done" on the forum (https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-5#post-20555393)


Other:
