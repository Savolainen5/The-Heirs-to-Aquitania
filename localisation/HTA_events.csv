EVTNAME31312;Aspiring New Military Leader;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC31312;A recent graduate from the Helvetian War College in Zurich has caught the eye of our top military brass. This young man, Johan von Habsburg, comes from a minor noble family from the vicinty of Aargau. It is believed that he will make a fine addition to our military staff.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50000;Death of King Raimond;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50000;King Raimond VIII died today of pneumonia at the age of 71. Coming to the throne in 1803, he guided the kingdom through a number of difficult wars, most notably the war against liberal revolutionaries in Hispania (1826-29). Thus, he saw stirrings of liberalism in the heart of the greatest power in the world. On his deathbed, he warned his son of the coming storm. Raimond IX now is king in Mauguio.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,
EVTNAME50001;Eyjafjallajokul Erupts!;x
EVTDESC50001;The volcano has once again erupted, and this time, the ash plume is enormous! Much of Europe will soon be engulfed. Hopefully they will not suffer too badly.;x
EVTNAME50002;The peasantry demands their food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50002;A large crowd appeared today at the gates of the royal palace in Mauguio. Disgruntled, emaciated peasants from both the city and surrounding farms demanded to be heard. The poor harvests of the past two years took their toll on the people of Aquitània as much as in other parts of Europe, yet Raimond IX continued to host lavish feasts. Incensed, the people demanded that the royal granaries be opened so that the people of Aquitània could eat the food they themselves grew. Upon hearing of the crowd and its demands, Raimond IX decided to…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,
EVTOPTA50002;… dismiss the rabble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB50002;… order the distribution of royal food aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME50003;The Return of the Iles Bleus;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50003;Now that we have reincorporated Normandy, we should start reclaim our colonies. The most obvious first target is the Îles Bleus, which Brittany calls Glasenezenn. They took control of our colony when we lost access to the Atlantic in the 17th century, but now we should get back what is rightfully ours. How shall we seek its return?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTOPTA50003;Offer to buy them back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB50003;Demand its return with no compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC50003;Seize the colony - This may lead to war!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME50004;France offers to buy Glasenezenn;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50004;We acquired these islands off the coast of Africa hundreds of years ago, claiming it when France lost control of its coast. Now our worst nightmare has been realised - France has returned. We are lucky that they have decided to ask nicely for the return of Glasenezenn, which they call the Îles Bleus. They may not take kindly to it if we refuse to sell them the islands. If it comes to war, perhaps we can ask Aquitània for aid. Will we sell to the French?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50006;Brittany refuses the sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50006;For one reason or another, the Bretons have turned down our generous offer. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME50007;France demands the return of Glasenezenn;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50007;Now our worst nightmare has been realised - France has returned. They have decided to take the route of trying to intimidate us on this issue. We claimed the islands when they lost access to the sea, but now the French want them back. If we refuse, it may come to war. We may be able to appeal for Aquitània for help in that case. Will we acquiesce to their demands, or will we stand up to the French?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;",,,,,
EVTNAME50009;Brittany has refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50009;The Bretons have foolishly, refused to hand over the Îles Bleus, which they call Glasenezenn. What will we do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME50010;France has seized our colony!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50010;Our worst nightmare has been realised: a resurgent France. Today, French troops seized our Atlantic colony in the Glasenezenn. How will we respond to this trespass? Obviously, if we refuse to accept it, it will probably lead to war. If it comes to yhat, perhaps we can appeal to Aquitània for aid?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,
EVTNAME50013;War with France!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50013;We are at war with our oldest nightmare. We cannot win alone. Shall we call for the aid of Aquitània?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME50014;Brittany calls for aid!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50014;Brittany is at war with France. Will you answer their call and fight by their side?;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME50017;France demands annexation!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50017;As if taking back its colony wasn't enough, now France is claiming historical overlordship of our country, and wants to see us "returned to the fold." Will we resist, or should we submit?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;",,
EVTNAME50020;War with France!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50020;We are at war with France, fighting for our identity and very survival! We cannot win alone.  Should we call for the aid of Aquitània?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;,,
EVTNAME50021;Brittany calls for aid!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50021;Brittany now fights for its very survival. Will Aquitània answer her call again?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME50022;Brittany Subdued;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50022;The struggles on the peninsula have been finished for some time now, and there are none in the world that would contest our claim to patrimony over the land of the Bretons. May Bretagne be forever French!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50024;The Fall of Tuscany;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50024;The Kingdom of Naples has sacked Florence and executed the Grand Duke of Tuscany. It is increasingly clear that the Neapolitans will not stop their warmongering until they have reached the Alps. We are next. Those few of us that remain free from the tyranny of Naples must put aside our differences or fall. To that end, let us propose a meeting of the leaders of Genoa, Lucca, and Venice, and see what sort of deal can be worked out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50025;Padan Conference Concluded;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50025;The Padan Conference has just recently concluded in Milan. It was attended by the dukes of Genoa, Lombardy, and Modena, as well as the Doge of Venice. The Duke of Daufinat also sent a representative to observe the proceedings. Despite mutual distrust - and in part because of it - a plan for a unified response to the Neapolitan threat was agreed upon: The suspension of the current ducal borders in favour of a federation governed by a council of representatives appointed by each constituent's ruler. In practice, this meant that each ruler had equal say in the dealings of the state. Thus, diplomatic and military functions were unified, but each constituent remained politically and economically independent. The intention was to dissolve the Union after the Neapolitan threat has been dealt with. Avanti, Padanesi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50026;Members Contribute to Treasury;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50026;Now that we have unified our military and diplomatic structures, the other members of the Padan Union have agreed to give their fair share of wealth to the common treasury. This will help us to arm ourselves against our enemies and better manage our economy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50027;Death of Duke Guigues XI;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50027;Duke Guigues XI, of the House de Buonavi, has unexpectedly passed away childless at the age of 43. Though he was married to Theresa of Franconia since before his inauguration in 1815, their union produced just two children, both of whom died too soon. The first, a daughter named Maria, died in childbirth, and the second, a son named Raimond, died in a hunting accident when he was 16 in 1829. As he lay dying of pneumonia, he told his council who the heir should be. Among the possibilities were the son of his sister, Eleonora, who married the brother of the Duke of Lombardy, Amedeo Morecini. There is also his cousin at court in Aquitània, Guigues de Mauguio, and his second cousin, Count Aymon of Chambéri. It is feared by the council that either Aquitània or the Padan Union may attempt to enforce the claims of one of the other contenders, possibly leading to war. But that is not a concern for now. Who did the late Duke choose to inherit Daufinat? \n§RNote: If you choose to become a puppet, you have less than two decades to avoid being annexed by Aquitània or Padan Union.§W;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50028;Duke Guigues XI chose a successor: Morecini!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50028;Because he died unexpectedly and childless, the Duke of Daufinat had to choose his successor from a selection of more distant relations than usual. As luck would have it, he chose his nephew, Amedeo Morecini, who happens to be the nephew of the duke of Lombardy! This represents a tremendous opportunity as a guaranteed ally in the new Duke. If we wish, we can exert some pressure to ensure that he remains subservient to us and aids us in our wars against Naples and any other projects we have. He may even be persuaded to join the Duchy to the Padan Union directly! How shall we react to his accession to the Duchy?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50029;Duke Guigues XI chose a successor: de Mauguio!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50029;Because he died unexpectedly and childless, the Duke of Daufinat had to choose his successor from a selection of more distant relatives than usual. Unfortunately, rather than choosing his nephew, who is the nephew of the Duke of Lombardy, he chose his cousin, Guigues de Mauguio, nephew of King Raimond of Aquitània, to be his successor. This means that Aquitània will exert a lot more influence on its old enemy and presents us with a threat on our western border. Aquitània has historically joined several wars against us as the ally of Naples, and may do so again. What's more, Daufinat controls territory that is decidedly Padanese in character, if not in practice. We now have even less chance to incorporate said territory into our own, which would be a great boon for our union! But we still could do something about this. We could press Amedeo Morecini's claim.  What will we do?;;;;;;;;;;;x

This means that the Padan Union will exert a lot more influence on our old enemy and presents us with a threat on our eastern border. We have historically fought several wars against the rulers of the Padan Union as the ally of Naples, and may do so again. What's more, Daufinat controls territory that is decidedly Aquitànian in character, if not in practice. We now have even less chance to incorporate said territory into our own, which would be a great boon for our country! But we still could do something about this.

EVTNAME50034;Remember Our Purpose!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50034;Remember that we banded together for one reason: To protect ourselves from Naples. We must not let our guard down, and we must not let the King try to subvert our cause and drive wedges between us. There can be no friendship between us and them until Tuscany and Romagna are free. Remember!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50035;Remember that we banded together for one reason: To protect ourselves from Naples, even though its King has claimed the title of King of Italy. We must not let our guard down, and we must not let the King try to subvert our cause and drive wedges between us. There can be no friendship between us and them until Tuscany and Romagna are free. Remember!;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50036;La Toscana viva ancora!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50036;With the help of our friends to the north in the Padan Union, Tuscany has been restored. We will not forget their invaluable aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50037;An invitation to join the Union;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50037;The Padan Union, whose formation we observed in-person, has proven to be a strong country capable of resisting Naples and enforcing their interests. Culturally and linguistically, we are quite close. Now, the Ducal Council has sent us an offer to join their country, which will strengthen us both. Our duke would get a seat on their council, giving us equal say in what would happen in the new Padan Union. What should our response to the invitation be?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50039;Daufinat turns down our offer;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50039;Unfortunately, the Duke of Daufinat has decided against banding together with us. He apparently believes that Daufinat is better off independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50040;The fate of Daufinat;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50040;The King of Aquitània has approached is with an offer: that we partition the Duchy of Dafinat. The territories on the Cisalpine side of the Alps would be ceded to us while the rest would go to Aquitània. We would gain land that could be considered rightfully Padanian, given that the Po river starts in that region. What shall we tell the King?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50041;The Padanese Council agrees!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50041;The Council of Dukes of the Padan Union has accepted our offer to work together and partition Daufinat. They will get the parts of the Duchy that are on their side of the Alps, and we will get the rest. It is a great day for $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50042;The Padanese Council declines!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50042;The Council of Dukes of the Padan Union has declined our offer to work together and partition Daufinat. They cited the moral problems with such an action and chastise us for even considering it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50043;Daufinat faces partition!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50043;It has come to light that Aquitània and the Padan Union have conspired to divide our country among themselves. We are facing our destruction. If we acquiesce, we will no longer enjoy the control and advantages of being independent, obviously. (If you're human, you will get a game over screen from this.) If we resist, we will inflict much death and destruction on our population.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50044;Daufinat will resist;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50044;The Duke of Daufinat has informed us that he will accept the partition of his patrimony and heritage only over his dead body and those of this people, despite the odds against him. We had hoped it would not come to this, but now it seems that war is the only option.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50045;The Partition of Daufinat;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50045;The Duke of Daufinat has accepted the terms of the partition. He will cede all of his holdings east of the Alps to the Padan Union and become the Duke of Ròse while someone from the Royal House will become Duke of Savouè. In practice, these will be titular titles only, but the Duke has spared himself and his people much suffering from this decision.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50046;The partition has gone as planned. The Duke of Daufinat has ceded all of his holdings east of the Alps to us. The Padan Union now fimally controls the entire length of the Po River!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50047;Partition War success!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50047;We have now successfully enforced our will on Daufinat, whose Duke died defending the Royal Palace in Grenoblo. His son, a boy of just 13, is the new duke and has been forced to sign a decree we wrote for him announcing the partition and end of the Duchy of Daufinat. It is a great day in the history of $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50048;Instability in Daufinat;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50048;The duke we helped to install in Daufinat less than two decades ago has fallen ill, and our spies tell us there is intrigue at court. There are two enterprising and ambitious landholding nobles who wish to replace him. If we do not intervene, one of them is sure to usurp the Duchy, and he will certainly have no love for us. What is our response?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50049;Daufinat accepts!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50049;The Duke of Daufinat has accepted our invitation and will join his land to the Padan Union as an equal member, with a seat on the council. Truly it is a great day for our people!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50050;Duchess Adelheid of Hannover dies;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50050;The Duchess of Hannover, Adelheid of Scharnburg-Hannover, died today at the age of 62. Her son, Duke Karl Ludwig von Edemissen of Brunswick, will inherit her title and holdings. Duchess Adelheid was adored by her subjects for her financial acumen and her compassion in visiting Hannoverian soldiers in hospitals and the field during the Imperial War (1829-1835). Under her, Hannover became a centre of trade and culture. Her loss is a grave one for all in the Duchy and in her family.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50053;Thieves strike the Royal Treasury!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50053;A group of thieves, who we have now identified as the notorious Steinberger Gang, have had the audacity to rob the Royal Treasury. They struck the Munich building very early yesterday morning during a changing of the guard. Among numerous invaluable items, the group made off with the crown jewels themselves! Our intelligence indicates that they have crossed the border into the Archbishopric of Mainz. How they managed to avoid notice is unknown. If we were to send troops into the Archbishopric to search for them, it would surely provoke a regionwide diplomatic incident, and the Imperial War is still a fresh memory. Shall we send in the troops?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50054;Bavarian troops cross the border;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50054;Two battalions of soldiers bearing the Bavarian flag crossed the border today and informed us that they were searching for fugitives from Bavarian authorities. Their presence is in direct violation of the Peace of Augsburg, and is of serious concern for the well-being of the citizenry and our sovereignty. Already, reports of fights and illegal interrogations have arisen. The officer in charge has refused our demands to leave Mainzer territory. Should we escalate the issue to the Bavarian government or let the situation unfold?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50055;Mainz demands the withdrawal of our troops!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50055;The Archbishop of Mainz has sent his first minister personally to demand the withdrawal of our troops from the Archbishopric. If we withdraw, we risk losing face and the Steinberger Gang will certainly get away. The longer we stay, though, the greater the risk of a more wide-spread diplomatic incident. What will we tell the minister?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50056;Mainz allows our soldiers to stay;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50056;After much deliberation, the Archbishop of Mainz informed us that our troops may stay, in exchange for certain guarantees about their conduct and our promise to withdraw when the job is done.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50057;Steinberger gang apprehended!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50057;After a thorough search, the five members of the Steinberger Gang were apprehended at an inn outside Darmstadt! All of their stolen goods and some more have been recovered and they are being escorted back to Munich for punishment. Now remains the question of what to do with our troops in the Archbishopric. We have an opportunity to use them as leverage against the Archbishop, who was among our enemies in the Imperial War, thus keeping him out of any future conflict with those to the north. Such a move would likely provoke serious diplomatic repercussions, however.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50058;Bavarians refuse to withdraw!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50058;Even after sending our first minister, the Bavarians will not remove their troops. We are faced with a serious diplomatic and political crisis. If we eject them, they may return in force or even declare war. If we allow them to stay, they may be used to hold us hostage, in a sense, forcing us to accede to the will of the King in Munich. Either way, there are dark times ahead for the Archbishopric. Perhaps we can call on the aid of Brunswick and Brandenburg once more, as we did during the Imperial War? In the meantime, what is our choice?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50059;Bavarians agree to withdraw!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50059;The King in Munich has folded to international pressure and our own negotiation and agreed to remove his troops from our territory. This is a great moral victory for us and has humiliated the Bavarians! Even worse for them, they can no longer continue their search for their fugitives. What a shame.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50060;Our troops physically ejected!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50060;Troops of the Archbishop of Mainz, greatly outnumbering our two battalions near Darmstadt, confiscated their weapons today and escorted them at gunpoint across the border. This is a great insult to the King and the Bavarian people, who just want to bring the Steinberger thieves to justice!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50061;Brunswick calls a Congress;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50061;The Duke of Brunswick, Karl Ludwig, has called the old allies from the Imperial War to Brunswick to deliberate on a response to Bavarian aggression against Mainz. It is widely feared that all princes of the north could soon be subject to the Bavarians unless we act. Will a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation be sent?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50062;The Duke of Brunswick, Karl Ludwig, has called the old allies from the Imperial War to Brunswick to deliberate on a response to our actions in Mainz, labeling it "warrantless aggression" and a "violation of the peace". Our contacts inform us that they intend to come up with a coordinated answer to the "threat" we pose to our old enemies.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50063;The Brunswick Congress;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50063;After much preparation, the Congress to debate the future of the princes of the north and our response to the threat of Bavaria has begun. Over the next few days, decisions of the utmost importance will be made, and we must do our best for $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50064;The Congress;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50064;The Congress opens! We have called the princes to debate the future of the North. We have decided that, given our leading role in the Imperial War, our vast landholdings, and our military might, we are the best choice to lead the North against Bavaria. Now we just have to convince the others of this. Brandenburg will contest our claim, and our advisors predict that the princes will side either with them or us. Few will dare to remain independent. Let us put forth our best, most persuasive arguments!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50065;The Congress;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50065;The factionalism of the past decade has once more come to the surface. The two foremost of the northern princes, Brunswick and Brandenburg, have gathered their supporters, each claiming that he is the best choice to face Bavaria. There have even been some claims to a "Kingdom of the Germans" tossed about. After a whole day of arguing and bickering, the Duke of Brandenburg stormed out of the room with several of his neighbours. We must decide if we will follow them, remain with Brunswick, or stand on our own.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50067;The Loyal Princes;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50067;After much debate and discussion at the Congress, a number of princes agreed to join $COUNTRY$ in facing Bavaria. They will now formally submit and join our country for the good of all! Many of the princes agreed to join our rival, and there was much tension at the roundtable between our two factions.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50069;The Brunswick Congress Ends;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50069;The Brunswick Congress, called to deliberate a northern German response to Bavaria's violation of the Peace of Augsburg, has come to a close. Marked by factionalism and bickering between the two major powers in the north, it has seen the myriad princes by and large joining either Brunswick or Brandenburg politically, so that there are now three major powers in what was once the Holy Roman Empire, excluding Bohemia, of course. War seems all the more likely now, as the belligerent tone in the region increases daily.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50070;The German Wars of Hegemony;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50070;Having consolidated their realms, the now-kings of the three major players in Germany have each proclaimed themselves "Emperor of All Germany", each alleging that the others are not worthy of the title. The threat of war looms in the region, and it is likely that in the coming years there will be much instability and fighting unless a diplomatic solution is found.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50071;Lübeck Once More in German Hands;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50071;We have incorporated this important port on the Baltic into our lands, and it is time to call it by its true name once again. All is now right in this city.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50072;The Dutch Cede Emden;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50072;Given the failure of any diplomatic option available to them regarding Emden, the Dutch have opted to merely cede us the city, instead of risking our ire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50099;Tuscany Brought into the Fold;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50099;With Tuscany and its people now in the loving embrace of the Padan Union, we can now claim truly to have ownership and rights over the land;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50100;The return of Monkceastre;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50100;Alba has sent an emissary with a proposition: They will return the rightfully-Aenglisc region of Monkceastre in exchange for the island of Ellan Mannin and an alliance against Éire. Alba wishes to reclaim one of its foremost cities from the Éirisc, and believes that if we back them, it can all be accomplished without bloodshed. Accepting this treaty would certainly reduce tensions here in the Northern Isles, but is it in our best interests to sign this treaty?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50101;Aengland signs the Treaty of Wyk!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50101;Aengland has agreed to back us and thus has taken our hand in friendship. This treaty means the return of Monkceastre to them, which we acquired in war several decades ago in exchange for their alliance and cession of Ellan Mannen to us.;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50102;Aengland refuses to sign!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50102;Aengland has refused our terms in the proposed treaty to exchange Monkceastre for Ellan Mannin and an alliance against the Éirannach!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50103;Alba issues the Glaschu Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50103;The King of Alba sent us an insulting message today, demanding that we cede the city of Glaschu back to Alba, from whom we took it in war in 1823. We are confident that we could beat them again if need be, but they have made overtures to Aengland and may be allied with them. This could potentially complicate matters. If we hand it back peacefully, we will lose face. On the other hand, we face war to hold on to it, a war which could be costly. What should we do about the city?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50104;Éire accedes to our demands!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50104;They have decided to return our city to us with no bloodshed. Perhaps we can now begin to repair relations with our Gaelige brothers.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50105;Éire refuses to comply!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50105;The fools have refused to see reason and return Glaschu peacefully. It seems that use of force is our only option! War is in our future.;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50106;Aengland Demands Annexation;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50106;In light of recent events affecting the relations between our two countries, Aengland has decided that they would like to establish direct control over our realm. They threaten to use force if necessary.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50107;Cymru Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50107;The Duke of Cyrmu has seen reason and has decided to accept the integration of his realm into ours in exchange for keeping his land and titles. May the long friendship between our peoples grow yet stronger with this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50108;Cymru Refuses Integration;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50108;The Duke of Cymru has refused to see reason and has stated that he will oppose any attempts by us to establish direct control over his realm with military force. Already, he is marshalling his army and stirring up his populace against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50109;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fishermen Attacked!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50109;In 1870, the population of cod and herring in the seas off the coast of northern Alba declined significantly. As a result, local fishermen had to venture further and further afield in search of a catch. The north, already poor, was pushed to desperation, and fishermen have been straying into Norwegian waters, putting them in conflict with Norwegian fishermen. Recently, a Norwegian warship opened fire on a fishing boat from the north, sinking the ship and killing three of the men aboard. Word has reached our government, and the Norwegians have as of yet not apologised for the incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50110;Fishermen from $FROMCOUNTRY$ Attacked!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50110;According to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, one of our warships patrolling near Hjeltland sank an innocent fishing ship from the north of Alba, killing some of the fishermen. However, our sailors report that the fishermen fired on them first. Now $FROMCOUNTRY$ is demanding that we compensate the families of the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50111;Norway Agrees to Compensate Us;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50111;They have seen reason, and have decided to give us just compensation for the rashness of their men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50112;Norway Refuses to Compensate Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50112;They have continued to stubbornly refuse to see reason, and have maintained that our desperate fishermen were at fault for the incident. Already, people in the villages of the north are clamouring for war. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50113;The End of Albina;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50113;With the loss of core territories on the island of Bryten, we can no longer claim to represent a united Albina. We cannot in good faith claim to represent all of Albnia any longer. It is the end, and we must once again take on the name of Aengland.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50114;The Colonies of Alba;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50114;With the independence of Alba drawing to a close, the matter of their colonies must be considered. These were Aenglisc colonies once, before the Albans betrayed us and our East India Company. When we control their homelands, they will have no choice but to answer to us or risk falling under foreign rule and losing everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50115;The First Seizures;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50115;With the defeat of Alba assured, it's time to take back our colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50116;Captain Strikes a Deal in the Comoros;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50116;An enterprising captain of one of our ships traveling to our Indian colonies recently sent us a message. While stopping in the Comoros, he learned that their king was having difficulties with Arab marauders harassing his people. This captain, Tanaide Mac Aodhagáin, made a show of force and scared off the raiders. Seeing the king impressed, he offered the full protection of $COUNTRY$ in exchange for certain rights that will ultimately grant us control over the island to the exclusion of other colonial powers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50117;Merchant Strikes a Deal on Maore;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50117;One of our merchantmen recently made a stop at Maore en route to the East Indies. It is still unclear exactly how he did it, but this Ulbert Wercban convinced the king of Maore to grant us exclusive trade rights on the island!;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME50118;The Defeat of Aengland;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50118;With its major cities occupied, Aengland has no choice but to accede to Albannach demands to release our Celtic brothers in Cymru and Kerno. This will free them from the oppression they have suffered for too long, and will handicap Aengland in the future. Our people celebrate this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50119;The Potato and Maize Blights;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50119;In the past year, concurrent blights on the potato and maize crops, which make up a significant proportion of the agricultural production of $COUNTRY$, have caused increasing alarm among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. There are now few regions of the country which are free from these blights, and people are considering emigrating or rebellion, especially if the government doesn't take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50120;The Great Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50120;In $YEAR$, the worsening difficulties of the concurrent potato and maize blights came to a head, as peasants angrily took to the streets of their towns, demanding that the nobility take action to aid their starving subjects. The grain the nobility controlled was unaffected, and so they were much less impacted by the famine than the lower classes. Today, as an angry mob appeared at the gates of the palace in $CAPITAL$, calling for relief, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government made a decision.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50121;The Great Famine is Over!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50121;At long last, it seems the worst of the blights have passed, and things have returned to normal in the countryside, with regular harvests. For better or worse, $COUNTRY$ has passed through this storm.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50122;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Constitutional Reform?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50122;With republican rebels recently occupying $CAPITAL$ and driving out our troops, the government must now seriously consider the threat the lower classes pose to it. They are calling for action on the many issues they think affect them, and are demanding more say in their own governance. The government now has two options: find a solution working with the leaders, or recall the troops and drive them out again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50123;The Éirisc Colonies;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50123;Éire has extensive colonies in India and other parts of the world, and now that we are putting an end to their freedom, we must seize the colonies, too. This time, no other country will have a chance to take them, otherwise they risk the full weight of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military against them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50124;Seumas Ó Máille;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50124;A longtime schoolteacher in $CAPITAL$, Seumas Ó Máille was uncommonly committed to his craft. In $YEAR$, he came before the government with numerous suggestions of reforms to be made to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ schooling system. The government, recognising the importance of a well-educated populace, quickly put him in charge of a newly-formed education ministry, and soon thereafter, schooling became compulsory in $COUNTRY$, bettering the life of its citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50125;Return to Breton Breizh;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50125;In the short time since our acquisition of Breizh, we have continued using the hitherto French terms for locales under our administration. Now that the dust has settled, however, we can officially restore the provinces and the entire state their proper Celtic names.;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50150;Death of the King of Mali;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50150;The King of Mali, a stabilising force in the region for over 40 years who personally knew his many vassals, died today at the age of 64. His son, the new king, is not the same man, and it willl be difficult for him to fill his father's shoes.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50151;Break the bonds of vassalage!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50151;With the death of the old, strong King and the help of Europeans, we have the opportunity to once again forge our own path. It will probably involve fighting and bloodshed, but it will be worth it!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50152;$FROMCOUNTRY$ revolts!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50152;The traitors in $FROMCOUNTRY$ have repudiated our overlordship. No doubt the cursed Europeans are to blame for this, as well as their opportunism and not giving the new King a chance! We have been friends since your father's father's father, and they would throw it all away because a few pale-skinned men offer them some trinkets and empty promises!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51600;The Aquitànian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51600;As if our current problems weren't enough. Our neighbour has fallen to Albesan rebel scum and we are dealing with misguided fools and traitors ourself. Now the new Republican government has sent us a demand: Concede to the rebels and establish democracy or face (another) war with Aquitània.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51601;Success in Daufinat;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51601;The Daufinens government has acceded to our demand to dismantle the ducal government and establish a democracy. Our troops and advisors will aid them in the transition period ahead. Needless to say, the peoples of both countries are thankful for their wise decision, as it has doubtless saved many lives.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51602;Daufinat Will Not Back Down;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51602;The Duke of Daufinat is defiant, even as his own people rise up against the oppressive government of the few. We must make good on our threat, lest the infant republic appear weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50200;The influence of Pier Moncani;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50200;Pier Moncani, a lesser son of the famous Prouvençale aristocrats, made his fortune using his pittance of an inheritance to open a factory producing fine silk garments, making himself a rich man and encouraging the silk industry in the Duchy. He used this fortune to get into the wine business, thereby involving himself in the two main industries of the Riviera Azur. As his wealth and fame grew, so, too, did his influence, especially with his workers, whom he treated very well. Lately, he has become enamoured of the liberal writings and thoughts of rising intellectuals of Helvetia and the Low Countries, and has been "educating" his workers in these dangerous ideas. The wave of liberal unrest sweeping Europe has arrived here, and Pier Moncani is only exacerbating the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50201;Royal family killed in palace assault!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50201;A peasant rabble numbering some 7000 marched on the royal palace in Touloun today, overpowering the few of the local garrison that remained loyal to the Duchy. They broke into the palace, and killed Duke Huc II, his wife Maria, and their four children, effectively ending the line of the House of Durano, which had ruled the Duchy since 1611. In its place, they established a republic of the people, the first liberal coup in Europe, but certainly not the last.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50203;Moncani proposes a solution;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50203;With the unrest in the country and the great pressure this has put us under, Pier Moncani has come to the Duke and Royal Council with a deal: He will calm his workers and help restore order to the country in exchange for chairmanship of the Royal Council and a list of poliical reforms. A popularly-elected legislature would be established to function as the lower house, through which the primary functions of the would function. This would very much reduce the power of the landed elites and essentially would make the Duke a figurehead in his own Duchy. It is unknown how Aquitània would respond to such a development in its long-time ally and neighbour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50205;Moncani becomes First Minister;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50205;Pier Moncani has been appointed the Chairman of the Royal Council, making him the Duchy's First Minister. He will use his influence to reduce the unrest in the countryside, but it is certain that reforms will have to be passed if we are to continue.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50206;Violent revolution in Prouvença!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50206;The same kind of liberal scum that toppled the Hispanian regime in 1826 have executed the ducal family of Prouvença and established a new revolutionary republic whose power is based on the will of the people rather than the history, glory, grandeur, and reputation of the monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50207;Political shakeup in Prouvença;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50207;Duke Huc II has given in to liberal pressure and appointed a wealthy liberal businessman and minour noble, Pier Moncani, to head up the Duchy's transition to a rule by the people. This will no doubt lead to the dismantlement of the power of the Duke. Given our history of friendship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and the growing power of the Padan Union, it would certainly be in our interests to maintain our relationship with the Duchy, which is quite similar to our own. Besides, if the Duke Huc were to lose power, surely the Moncani would be hostile to us, given our leading role in the Hispanian War.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50208;Aquitània demands Moncani's removal;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50208;King Raimond IX has demanded the removal of Pier Moncani from the chairmanship of the Royal Council. If you refuse, your Highness, King Raimond has stated he will consider force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50211;Rebels under Pier Moncani storm the Royal Palace!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50211;After being removed from his position as chairman of the Royal Council, Pier Moncani has decided that the liberal cause can only see success through violence. He used his influence in the capital and the country to gather a mob of commoners and peasants and led them in storming the Royal Palace in Touloun. The royal family was killed, and confused rumours are flying about whether Moncani killed Duke Huc himself or whether he tried to prevent the death of the family. Regardless, Moncani has set himself up as President of the Republic of Prouvença and is organising free and open elections!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50212;Rebellion in Prouvença;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50212;Moncani has caused the end of the line of Durano, Dukes of Provence. He has personally overturned the monarchical system that has existed for well over a millennium in that region.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50213;Moncani Captured!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50213;Pier Moncani, upstart revolutionary who defied Aquitània and provoked war, was found today hiding in a run-down shack in the hills a few kilometers outside of Digno. He has been arrested, and, with the fall of the government he helped create, Prouvença has ceased to exist and will forevermore be a part of Aquitània. The soldiers escorted him to Touloun, and from there, he will be brought to Mauguio.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50214;Aquitània Invites Us into their Republic;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50214;Given the Republic of Aquitània's size and prestige relative to our own, and the historical, cultural, and linguistic ties we have, they have seen fit to invite us into their republic, saying that we would fit very well and would have an equal say in the happenings of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50217;The People of Prouvença Embrace Us!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50217;It has not been long that our peoples have been joined under our flag, yet our officials and newspapers constantly praise the people of our newly acquired territories has being entirely friendly and open to us! Truly, they are Aquitànians!;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50220;Daufinat Joins the Padan Union;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50220;The rulers of Daufinat have seen fit to join the Padan Union, no doubt considering their Cisalpine inhabitants in the Alpine valleys and the Piemont. However, their capital and a significant proportion of their population is found on our side of the Alps, in the Rosè region. Would it not be better if these were joined with their cultural kin in $COUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50221;The Royal Family Flees $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50221;With the increasingly hostile environment because of the ongoing rebellion, Raimond IX and his family have fled. Their destination is unknown at this time. The military has by and large either joined the people or simply refused to fire on our revolutionaries. However, they aren't helping us find the royal family, and it may be that they remain a threat in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, we must look to setting up a government of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50222;Formation of the National Council;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50222;In these heady days of newfound freedom, the leaders of our revolution have been working tirelessly and have decided to form a new government for the Republic: the National Council. Consisting of two delegates from each province of the Republic, the National Council over the following days will take on all matters of legislative and executive governance. While the people continue to celebrate, the revolution must look to more serious matters.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50223;"The Heirs to Aquitània";;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50223;As the dust settled in the aftermath of the Aquitànian revolution, the newly-formed National Council began its work. Jacin Alòi Ilmunt, delegate from Mauguio, quickly gained fame and popularity following his speech made on this day.\n\n"... Now it is a new day. For centuries, the people of our great country were kept down, hungry, quiet. The kings sat in their palace, caring little for their long-suffering people, ignoring their plights at every turn and seeking only to enrich themselves. And they claimed to represent Aquitània. Long ago, Aymar I claimed that he and his line were the heirs to Charlemagne's Aquitània, an assertion which was reiterated throughout the history of the House of Mauguio. But no, our glorious revolution has contended - and proved - otherwise. They are not the rightful heirs. They are not the children of Charlemagne. No, it is the people. WE are the heirs to Aquitània! A country of freedom, of glory, of prosperity, which was always meant to be so. Let us make that true for all Aquitànians! My friends, my brothers, my countrymen, let us strive for greatness together!";x
EVTNAME50224;Aquitànian Forces Cease Fighting;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50224;With news a couple of days ago that the Royal Family fled the palace and a new government was established, hastily formed committees of soldiers from across the military of the country have proclaimed to their officers that they will no longer fight the wars of the powerless king. Faced with the prospect of mass mutiny or worse, Aquitànian generals and lower officers have accepted their demands and are now marching home. The war is over, but we will see what comes of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50250;The New Brabant Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50250;We have received a message from the Brabantian ambassador that they are willing to sell their Pacific colony in the New Brabant islands to us, for the right price. Perhaps we should consider making an offer before someone else snaps it up? The islands may not be very useful for us now, but could prove useful for later colonisation attempts in the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME50251;The New Brabant Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50251;We have received an offer from $FROMCOUNTRY$ to purchase the New Brabant Islands. Should we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME50254;Brunswick Requests a Meeting about Emden;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50254;The newly-expanded Kingdom of Brunswick would like to meet in Twist, just across the border, to discuss the possibility of returning Emden to German hands. We seized the province in 1827 from Oldenburg as reparation for unpaid debt, and have held it ever since. It is home to a sizeable number of Dutch speakers and serves as a useful naval base. However, it is quite small and lightly-populated, so it would be no great loss, and handing it over to Brunswick would do wonders for the security of our German border.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50255;The Netherlands Signs the Treaty of Twist;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50255;Seeing reason, the Dutch have agreed to relinquish Emden and their claims to it to us. This will do wonders for our relations and the geopolitical situation on our western border.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50256;The Netherlands Refuses the Treaty of Twist;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50256;For some reason, the Dutch have decided that they will not relinquish Emden, and instead of informed us that they intend to retain control of the town and surrounding region.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50257;Emden Regained!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50257;We have regained Emden from the Dutch. We can now claim to own it permanently, and they would be fools to attempt to take it back.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50259;The Emden Accords;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50259;An envoy from the Netherlands has arrived. With the recent formation of $COUNTRY$ and its rise to international power, the Dutch have begun to worry about tensions between our two countries in light of their continued ownership of the city of Emden. We have an historical claim on the city, and a significant proportion of its population is German. \n\nThe Dutch seek to resolve the issue and forestall any possible diplomatic problems by offering us some kind of compensation in exchange for us relinquishing any ambitions against the city. Will we accept their offer to meet and discuss the situation?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50260;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to Negotiate;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50260;They will come to the table at meet us in the Stadhuis of Emden, the centre of government in the city. We must now decide what compensation we will offer them: a sum of 15000, part of our colony on the Zuidenkaap in Africa, or Hemelvaart and Mauritius.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50261;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses to Negotiate;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50261;They have stated that they will under no circumtances relinquish German claims on Emden. It may come to war in the future, since they refuse a diplomatic option.;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50262;The Dutch Offer Money;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50262;The negotiators in Emden have been offered a sum of 15000 guilders in exchange for our agreement to relinquish our claims on Emden. However, it appears that there were other possible offers they were considering: a section of the colony at the southern end of Africa or some of their waystation islands on either side of Africa. Will we accept their offer or make our own proposition?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50263;The Dutch Offer Oostkaap;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50263;The negotiators in Emden have been offered the Dutch colony of Oostkaap in exchange for our agreement to relinquish our claims on Emden. However, it appears that there were other possible offers they were considering: a sum of 15000 guilders or some of their waystation islands on either side of Africa. Will we accept their offer or make our own proposition?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50264;The Dutch Offer Waystation Islands;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50264;The negotiators in Emden have been offered the waystation islands of Hemelvaart and Mauritius in exchange for our agreement to relinquish our claims on Emden. These islands are used by their navy as bases and supply points in transit around Africa, and could be used to help us project our power into the Indian Ocean. It also appears that there were other possible offers they were considering: a section of the colony at the southern end of Africa or a sum of 15000 guilders. Will we accept their offer or make our own proposition?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50265;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Delegation Accepts Compensation;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50265;In a best-possible-outcome situation, the German negotiators have accepted the sum of 15000 guilders in exchange for relinquishing Emden. Let us finalise the deal now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50266;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Oostkaap;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50266;They somehow heard of our discussion about this prior to the talks, and have come to the conclusion that we would be willing to offer this colony in place of the 15000 guilders we have officially offered.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50267;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Mauritius and Hemelvaart;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50267;They somehow heard of our discussion about this prior to the talks, and have come to the conclusion that we would be willing to offer these islands as naval bases instead of the 15000 guilders we have officially put on the table.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50268;They somehow heard of our discussion about this prior to the talks, and have come to the conclusion that we would be willing to offer them the 15000 guilders we had considered instead of Oostkaap.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50269;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts Oostkaap;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50269;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Delegation in Emden has accepted the deal and $FROMCOUNTRY$ will take possession of Oostkaap in exchange for disavowing claims on Emden. Let us finalise the deal.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50270;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts Mauritius and Hemelvaart;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50270;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation in Emden has accepted the deal and $FROMCOUNTRY$ will take possession of the waystation islands Mauritius and Hemelvaart in exchange for disavowing claims on Emden. Let us finalise the deal.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50271;The $FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50271;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation in Emden has accepted the deal and we will receive the sum of 15000 guilders in exchange for disavowing claims on Emden. The Emden Accords are concluded.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50272;The $FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50272;Our Dutch counterparts have finalised the deal and will now cede us their colony of Oostkaap in Africa. The Emden Accords are concluded.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50273;The $FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50273;Our Dutch counterparts have finalised the deal and will now cede us the waystation islands of Hemelvaart and Mauritius. The Emden Accords are concluded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50274;The Dutch Refuse: Money or Nothing;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50274;Our counteroffer has been turned down and the Dutch negotiators are very firm: They will give compensation, as they originally proposed, and will accept no other deal. We may take the offer or leave it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50275;The Dutch Refuse: Waystations or Nothing;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50275;Our counteroffer has been turned down and the Dutch negotiators are very firm: They will cede us Hemelvaart and Mauritius, as they originally proposed, and will accept no other deal. We may take the offer or leave it.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME50280;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons the Accords;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50280;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation walked out of the Stadhuis in Emden today after we failed to come to an agreement on the status of the city. They cited our unwillingness to budge on the form of compensation, and our people blame the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ greed in asking for something we were unwiling to offer.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50300;The Halesca Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50300;We have received a message from a prominent Hispanian diplomat that they are willing to sell their Halesca colony to us, for the right price. Perhaps we should consider making an offer before someone else snaps it up? The land would give us full control over the northern part of the Pacific coast, and owning it would be a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC50301;We have received an offer from $FROMCOUNTRY$ to purchase the Halesca colony. Should we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME50304;The Hispanian Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50304;Navarra and Hispania have always had a close relationship. Basque culture is widely accepted throughout Hispania, and Navarra was an informal vassal of Hispania until the end of the Hispanian Revolutionary War. Today we have received word that the Hispanian government is offering the opportunity for Navarra to establish this relationship once more. What shall we say?.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50305;Navarra Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50305;Navarra has accepted our offer to become a vassal of the Hispanian nation. While this is good news, some ministers are concerned that other nations will take offense to our new union. Should we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50306;Navarra Refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50306;Today we received word that the Navarran government has chosen to refuse our offer of union. Some ministers are urging that we press our claim to the Basque regions no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50307;Funding Rebels in Hispania?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50307;Several years ago, a young officer in our army by the name of Marco Diniz was dishonorably discharged for being in possession of anarchist and socialist literature. While we of course cannot tolerate such thoughts in our own country, authorities tend to turn a blind eye towards what our citizens might do abroad. Recently, it has come to our attention that Diniz has been making trips across the border to organize anarchist cells in Hispania. Some members of our government believe this might be the perfect opportunity to destabilize our dangerous neighbor to the east. How should we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50308;Portugal Supports Anarchist Rebels!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50308;In a police raid on an anarchist cell near the western border, our men arrested a Portuguese national named Marco Diniz, an ex-military officer who is organizing rebel militia. Under interrogation, Diniz revealed that he is acting on behalf of the Portuguese government. We will of course execute him, but the real question is what our response to Portugal should be. Our foreign minister has prepared a set of demands to the Portuguese government that will drastically reduce their ability to interfere with our sovereignty and finally take care of what has been a perpetual thorn in our side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50309;The Hispanian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50309;Our man Marco Diniz was recently caught by Hispanian security forces, and under torture he confessed to receiving our support. In response, Hispania has expelled our ambassador and delivered us with a list of demands that would in effect reduce us to that of a vassal state under their rule. While our military is probably unable of confronting Hispania alone, we might have better luck by seeking an alliance with Aquitània. The Hispanian military is already mobilizing on our border, and we need to make a decision now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC50310;An incident involving Portuguese support for socialist and anarchist terrorist cells in Hispania has rapidly spun out of control, and the Hispanian government is using the situation as an excuse to reassert its rule over Portugal. Now, the Portuguese have come to us with a desperate plee for an alliance in the face of Hispanian aggression. Should we step into the ring, or let this one play out on its own?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50311;Portugal Yields to Our Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50311;After being unable to secure any backers on the international stage and considering our obvious military superiority, today Portugual has surrendered to the inevitable. The government has agreed to accept our demands and Hispanian troops are already moving in to secure key administrative offices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50312;Aquitània Supports Portugal;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50312;Portugal has quickly worked out a deal with Aquitània, wherein $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to objectively "mediate" the situation. This is, of course, a thinly-veiled attempt to check our diplomatic ability and intefere with our rightful sphere of influence. Now Aquitània is demanding that our troops stand down, or they will use military force to back Portugal. If we want to proceed with operations against Portugal, we had better be prepared to face both nations at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50313;Aquitània Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50313;Unfortunately, the Aquitànian government has declined our plea for assistance, citing troubles closer to home and a lack of desire to interfere with Hispanian foreign policy. Our options are looking increasingly limited.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50350;Yakuts subjugated!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50350;With the end of the 1840 campaign of Count Aleksei Boroditzki against the Yakuts, $COUNTRY$ could claim overlordship over much of eastern Siberia, almost to the Pacific coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50351;Western Coast Fully Explored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50351;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ explorers have worked tirelessly in recent years to explore the newly-claimed regions beyond Siberia, on the frigid coast of the Pacific Ocean. While there are still some blank spots on the map inland, we now have accurate maps of the coast, and can truly enforce our claims and being settlement in earnest.\n\nThis event will also reduce some liferatings that are too high, so don't worry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50354;The Infant Tsar Michael;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50354;Feodor II, Tsar of All Russia, on his deathbed at the age of 78, today decreed a regent for his grandson and heir Michael, a boy of just 8 years. Just a few hours later, he fell asleep and did not wake up - a fact which in the 20th century would spawn a number of conspiracy theories regarding the new regent and the concentration of power in his hands. There were three contenders for the position.\n\nDaniil Vorontsov, a newcomer to the court, had been hired as tutor to the royal children and quickly worked his way into the Tsar's confidence. Igor Orlov was one of the most senior generals - indeed, the oldest, at 73 years of age - on the Tsar's military staff, who had worked with Tsar Feodor for more than three decades. Afanasii Derzhavin was a product of the westernised bureaucracy that had been instituted at the end of the 18th century; a competent administrator with strong networking skills.\n\nThe old Tsar, God rest his soul, chose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME50355;Military Discontent with Vorontsov;x
EVTDESC50355;Word has reached the Kremlin that many in the military are unhappy with the choice of the "unqualified" Vorontsov for the choice of regent. Bureaucrats clearly feal similarly that one of the other candidates was a far more obvious choice. We shall have to keep our wits about us in the coming days, to ensure that a full-fledged rebellion does not break out over this.;x
EVTNAME50356;Growing Military Misgivings;x
EVTDESC50356;Vorontsov and his government have not done enough to assuage the military. Some soldiers, who have continued to remain loyal to the Tsar and the Empire, have reported that there are increasing - though quiet - calls for action by the officers.;x
EVTNAME50357;Palace Coup Averted;x
EVTDESC50357;Somehow, Vorontsov was able to stop a coup organized against him today all by himself. Rumours are already circulating about the circumstances of the event, but suffice it to say that all the officers involved came out of a meeting with the Regent professing staunch loyalty to the Tsar, the Empire, and the Regent. They immediately proceeded to crack down on their former co-conspirators. The streets of Moscow run red with blood today, as surely do many other parts of the Empire.;x
EVTNAME50364;Death of Vsevolod Feodorovich;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50364;The Emperor's only male son, Vsevolod, died today of typhus at just 39 years of age. The illness developed from a cold the prince caught while traveling to a sanatorium with his ailing wife.\n\nAs the Tsar has no other male issue, he has named his late son's child, Michael, heir to the throne. Furthermore, the Tsar has ordered the construction of a sanitarium near Vladimir in his son's honour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50365;Michael Comes of Age;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50365;On this day, Tsar Michael II has come of age, acceeding to the throne and being coronated. There have been massive celebrations in the streets at the return of a Tsar Batiushka to the throne, although time will tell if Michael will fill his grandfather's shoes in that respect. With his accession, the services of the regent are no longer required.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50366;Tsar Batyushka Feodor;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50366;Our beloved Tsar has been cultivating his image as a father figure to his entire country. Most of the peasantry now see him as a loving man who looks out for them and wants the best for them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50367;Ukrainians Demand More Concessions;x
EVTDESC50367;Yet more agitation among the Ukrainians, and worse news. It seems that they have secretly been organizing a government and have presented demands: Grant the whole of Ukraine autonomy within the kingdom, or face rebellion. Can we face such a challenge to our power now, when we are at war with our northern neighbours?;x
EVTNAME50368;Ukrainians Rebel;x
EVTDESC50368;Despite the repression we have undertaken over the last several years, Ukrainians have continued to pose a significant problem. Now with few troops in the area due to the war with our northern neighbour, the peasantry are arming themselves, and a formerly underground government has established control over all of their lands! Now we must put them down, too!;x
EVTNAME50369;Cossacks Commit;x
EVTDESC50369;We have received word that the Cossacks will fight for us against Smolensk.;x
EVTNAME50370;Cossacks Turn Against Us;x
EVTDESC50370;It seems that the Tatars have joined our enemies, the vile schemers!;x
EVTNAME50371;Rebellious Ukrainians;x
EVTDESC50371;The people of Ukraine, with whom we have frequently had troubles in the many years they have lived under our rule, have once again begun to agitate against our rule. What began as a local protest against high taxation has spread and been taken up by Ukrainian nobility. We have two options. If we decide to grant them concessions to placate them in the short term, it will certainly cause us to lose face with the many other peoples in our empire, particularly our own. If, instead, we decide to send troops and suppress them, we may face yet further troubles down the road.;x
EVTNAME50372;Ruthenian Unrest;x
EVTDESC50372;The Ruthenian people in the southwest of our country have long been a thorn in our sides. Divided between Smolensk and Poland, they are staunch Catholics who speak a language closely related to that of the White Russians and Ukranians. Of late, there have been stirrings of nationalism in their towns and villages. Many have seen our treatment of their Ukranian cousins and have begun to rebel, hoping for their own chance at freedom. We could grant them concessions or suppress them violently. Each may have further repercussions.;x
EVTNAME50373;The Knyaz of Vitebsk Dies;x
EVTDESC50373;Knyaz Pyotr IV, a second cousin of Tsar Feodor, has died unexpectedly today at the age of 43. Long a sickly man, he died without issue. The Tsar was a close confidant and the Knyaz wished for him to take over the Principality, a wish bolstered by the fact that the Tsar has the strongest claim to the throne in Vitebsk. However, should his Highness decide otherwise, surely some more distant relative can be placed on the throne. Otherwise, we shall see to it that the Imperial administration takes care of the Principality in Your name. Who shall succeed the late Knyaz?;x
EVTNAME50374;The Fate of Vitebsk;x
EVTDESC50374;With our victory over the Russians, it is time to decide what to do about the former Tsar's relative's domain - Vitebsk. A pliant relative with some legitimacy could be installed on the throne, effectively creating a vassal in the principality. Alternatively, that same relative could rule as a governor, thus representing our direct control over the region. If the principality is allowed to continue to exist, we will likely need to wait until our claimant passes on before we can assume direct control.;x
EVTNAME50375;Vitebsk Revisited;x
EVTDESC50375;The Knyaz we installed on the throne has died. Now is the perfect time to take control of the principality, should we so desire. If not, we can install a successor, and thereby allow Vitebsk to continue as our vassal. It will then be some time before we can make a new decision about its fate.;x
EVTNAME50376;The Black Sea Provinces;x
EVTDESC50376;Our lands on the Black Sea are cut off from the capital. The ships lay wasting away in the harbour in Sevastopol, nowhere to go. Ukraine and the Cossacks are raiding the provinces freely, and clearly intend to take them for their own. They are lost to us!;x
EVTNAME50377;The Fall of Smolensk;x
EVTDESC50377;After our lightning march down the Vyazma Road and our easy victory over the hasty and half-hearted defence the Army of Smolensk put up, we have conquered their capital and captured the Korol. While breaking the truce has provoked some controversy, it has all been worth it. All Russia is at peace!;x
EVTNAME50380;Polish Territorial Claims in Brest;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50380;The Poles, although soundly defeated in the Belarussian War in 1748, continue to claim the region of Brest, which happens to be home to significant numbers of Poles. Now that we have gone to war with Russia, the cowards, sensing weakenss, have seen fit to demand that we return the territory, despite our own good claims on it. We must ask ourselves if we can risk war with Poland and the so-called Russia at the same time.\n\n(Note: The territory will transfer when Poland gets your response.);;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50381;The Treaty of Brest;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50381;Polish and Smolenskii officials met in the city of Brest, centre of Polish claims since the 1748 Belarussian War, to discuss terms of the return of the region to Poland. It was decided that the territory would be bought for a fee, which many in Smolensk would decry as a pittance compared to the value of the land, but it bought peace on the beleaguered kingdom's western borders, which Smolenskii officials considered good value for money.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50382;No Agreement Over Brest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50382;Smolensk has refused to negotiate, and claims the territory is rightfully theirs. It falls to us to decide whether to back up our threat with force - to declare war -, or not. By accepting their decision, Poland will certainly lose face and accept the result of the Belarussian War.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50383;Byelorussians Rebel;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50383;While the White Russians have always had some grievances against our rule, things have generally gone well. That is, until recently. Several events across Belarus have incited the Byelorussians against us. Our spies report that the Poles may be behind this, but at the moment we have to focus on the effects of their skullduggery.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50384;Byelorus is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50384;The Byelorussians have us - in part - to thank for their independence. Our support was crucial in their struggle for freedom, and our countries now look forward to a new friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50385;The Tatars Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50385;Our relationship with the Tatars has always been tense, and it has largely been our military prowess that has kept them in check. Now they have seen an opportunity in the Russians to gain new freedoms for themselves. Their troops have left the front and begun raiding our lands!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50386;The Tatars Join the War;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50386;Honouring our agreement, the Cossacks of the pre-Caucasian steppe have ceased their cooperation with the Smolenskiis and are now joining our side in the war.\n\nNB human players, you have to call them in manually.;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50387;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Chastened;x
EVTDESC50387;We have achieved a glorious victory. International opinion was certainly divided - we are told that the Duke of Mecklenburg lost a sizable amount in his bet with the Duke of Pomerania. We have proven the strength of our faith and our great nation. While we were unable to crush the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ state completely, it is now only a matter of time before the people dethrone their ruler and join us.;x
EVTNAME50388;The Peace of $CAPITAL$;x
EVTDESC50388;The palace, at last empty of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers, seems a darker place than before the war. The bitter defeat which we have suffered at the hands of our inferior enemy has shocked everyone, from the highest minister to the lowest illiterate peasant, be he Great Russian or otherwise. As they begin turning against us, our position looks extremely weak. Can $COUNTRY$ survive the coming years?;x
EVTNAME50389;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Falls;x
EVTDESC50389;The people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have thrown off their shackles and cried en masse to join us! The leadership of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has fled into exile, and the Great Russians are united under the banner of $COUNTRY$. A glorious day!;x
EVTNAME50391;The Development of $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50391;A number of advisors and members of the military establishment have recently proposed that the government develop $PROVINCENAME$ as the main port for our navy in the Black Sea. They have already gathered some of the requisite funds, but request a cash infusion from and the blessing of the government to begin the project in earnest. They will begin fortification of the port and city as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50392;Dead Souls;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50392;In $YEAR$, prominent author Nikolai Gogol published a novel entitled "Dead Souls," in which the main character buys dead serfs from countryside nobility in order to gather enough "property" or "wealth" to appear to be an important nobleman so that the governor will wed him his daughter. This was possible because of the quite infrequent censuses and corruption at local levels of government. Gogol's novel presents the government with an opportunity for reform, or it could easily be ignored.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50394;The Great Drive South;x
EVTDESC50394;The vast steppes and deserts of Central Asia will not for long present the buffer they once did. Indeed, they present an opportunity for $COUNTRY$. By controlling this land, we may derive (in time) economic gain, but more importantly, it could represent a stepping stone to further imperial ambitions to the south. Imagine $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ports on the Indian Ocean. We must have this land. Let us establish more direct control over the tribes, and organize them into a proper government, directed by us, of course.;x
EVTNAME50395;Military Morale Low!;x
EVTDESC50395;Many in the military see the current war - a monumental struggle for the soul of Russia and our country's very existence - as a lost cause. Desertion is common, and the men are not fighting to their potential. This despite our best efforts to assuage their fears about the future. Let us hope that this situation does not lead to the end of $COUNTRY$.;x
EVTNAME50399;Financial Support from the Church;x
EVTDESC50399;The Church pays its share to the state to help unify Great Russians.\n\nNB: This event will only fire as long as SML is independent and railroading is on.;x
EVTNAME50400;West Slavic Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50400;The call has come to $COUNTRY$ to unite with Zachadia, a union of West Slavic countries interested in protecting themselves and each other from the encroachment of other European powers. Whether a union of peoples who have not always peacefully coexisted, and indeed have considerable distrust of one other, will be difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50403;Study Room Meetings;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50403;In recent months, more and more of the powerful nobility of Hungary have been holding so-called "Study Room Meetings." It began in Szekesfehervar with the Orczy estate, and he has been influential in encouraging others to do the same. A man we have on the inside tells us that in these meetings, the nobility and their scions discuss and debate liberalism and Hungarian nationalism. If left alone, they will almost certainly begin fomenting dissent and rebellion among our Hungarian subjects.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50404;Liberal Pamphlets Discovered;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50404;We have stumbled upon pamphlets in $PROVINCENAME$ which advocate liberalism. They tell the reader of the "virtues" of republicanism, they promise the reader justice and equality for all, and they exhort the reader to dream of a free Hungary in which this is possible. Clearly, these pamphlets were meant to be kept from our clutches.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50405;Study Room Meetings in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50405;Inspired by the the example Orczy set in Szekesfehervar, local nobles in $PROVINCENAME$ have begun holding meetings and discussing liberalism and Hungarian nationalism, and this will doubtless seep out into the general public nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50406;Bohemia and the Zadar Proposition;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50406;An envoy from Bohemia approached us today with a proposition. The Kingdom would like for us to lease or cede them the port of Zadar, and in exchange they are prepared to offer us monetary compensation in the amount of 25000 and will build the rail lines in our territory which they would need to access the port from Hungary. We could probably convince the Bohemians to give us 30000, or we could take a smaller sum of money - some 20000 - and ask for their help regaining Zagreb and the other provinces lost to Austria during the War of 1782.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50407;Croatia Accepts Compensation for Zadar;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50407;The Duke of Croatia has graciously agreed to accept compensation to lease us the port of Zadar. However, Croatia will accept no payment less than 30000. Will we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50408;Croatia Wants its Land Back for Zadar;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50408;Croatia has agreed to lease us Zadar, but before that, the Duke demands a sum of 20000 AND our aid in returning them Zagreb and its associated provinces in the historical region of Old Croatia, which it lost in the Treaty of Judenburg in 1783.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50409;Croatia Refuses our Proposition;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50409;The Duke has said there is no chance that he will allow us to control such a valuable city and port in his realm. Unfortunately, it seems that path is closed to us. Should we press the issue or look elsewhere?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50410;Bohemia Accepts the Deal;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50410;They have agreed to the new sum we proposed, and we will now turn over Zadar to the Bohemian government. All other clauses will now take effect, such as the transfer of the sum agreed upon, the building of railroads, and other minour details.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50411;Bohemia Accepts the Deal;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC50411;They have agreed to the new sum we proposed, although they have cited financial concerns and will pay it in yearly installments of 5000. We will now turn over Zadar to the Bohemian government. All other clauses will now take effect, such as the transfer of the sum agreed upon, the building of railroads, and other minour details.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50412;Bohemia Pays an Installment;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50412;Another year has passed, and the Kingdom of Bohemia pays another installment in its fee to lease Zadar from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50413;Bohemia Abandons the Zadar Deal;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50413;Citing internal reasons, an envoy from the Kingdom of Bohemia decided not to pursue the deal to lease Zadar from us any further. We can consider the case closed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50414;Bohemia Agrees to Help us Recover our Land;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50414;It was a long shot, but our gamble to ask Bohemia to help us require Old Croatia paid off, and they accepted! The Bohemians have committed to acquiring our land from Austria, and now we only need to wait.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50415;Our Lands Returned!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50415;Old Croatia is back in our hands, and thus our lands are more or less whole for the first time in three generations. Bohemia has upheld its end of the agreement about Zadar, and now it's time for us to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50416;Bohemia and Old Croatia;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50416;Our neighbours, the Bohemians, have sent a delegation to us and have proposed a deal: we grant them ownership of the Old Croatia region in exchange for monetary compensation. We hear that this is part of a deal they struck with Croatia to regain their lost land, and it isn't unlikely that, should the deal fall through, Bohemia would consider force of arms to acquire this territory.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50417;Austria Asks for Fair Compensation;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50417;In our bid to acquire Old Croatia from the von Rassos, they have agreed to the proposition and ask that they only be compensated some 15000. Will we accept this amount?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50418;Austria Asks for Significant Compensation;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50418;In our bid to acquire Old Croatia from the von Rassos, they have agreed to the propositing on the condition that they be compensated significantly, to the tune of 35000. Will we accept?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50419;Austria Refuses to Give us Old Croatia;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50419;The von Rassos have stated in clear terms that they will not give us Old Croatia, for one reason or another. This is a most disappointing setback.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50420;Bohemia Agrees to Pay;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50420;They have already submitted the agreed-upon amount, and now we should make good on our end of the deal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50421;Bohemia Backs Out of the Agreement;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50421;Citing domestic concerns, Bohemia has decided to stop pursuing our deal in regards to Old Croatia.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50426;Rebellion in Syrmia;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50426;With the ongoing famine in the already-impoverished region of Syrmia, local peasants, led by Hungarian nobility, have risen up and assaulted our tax collectors and government officials. They demand immediate relief and other changes which are impossible at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50427;Separated from Syrmia;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50427;With the loss of a means to access Syrmia, we can no longer claim to be overlords of that land...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50428;Revolt in the Banat;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50428;Inspired by the example set by Syrmia, peasants, once again egged on by Hungarian nobility, have risen up in open revolt! They demand tax and levy relief and other things which are entirely impossible to agree to.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50429;Separated from the Banat;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50429;With the loss of a means to access the Banat, we can no longer claim to be overlords of that land...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50430;Fractured Territory;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50430;Our lands are now separated, lost to another unfriendly country. So it is in Syrmia, where our loss of the Banat has made it impossible to reach and govern that territory. Whether we like or not, Syrmia is essentially independent now...;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50431;Fractured Territory;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50431;Our lands are now separated, lost to another unfriendly country. So it is in the Banat, where our loss of the rest of Western Transylvania has made it impossible to reach and govern that territory. Whether we like or not, the Banat is essentially independent now...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50440;A Private Meeting with Hungarians;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50440;A delegation from the Hungarian Committee for Independence requested a private audience with our government today, and put forth an interesting proposition. There are apparently plans for a significant revolt, and they would like to count on our military support. To sweeten the deal, they promised to ensure that we get some Bohemian territory out of it, which would at the least be a boon to our industry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50441;Call on Aid;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50441;Our long-planned rebellion has begun. It is now time to remind other countries of their promises and the spoils that await them. They will join us in our war of freedom from Bohemia, with any luck, and we will be victorious!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50442;War with Bohemia;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50442;We are at war with our former friends or masters. Let us unify our relationship and diplomatic statuses, and stop being puppets, spherelings, or allies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50443;Treaty of Szekesféhervar Negotiations;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50443;The War of Hungarian Independence has finished, and we have been victorious over Bohemia. All parties have agreed to meet at the royal hunting estate outside of Szekesféhervar to negotiate the details. A partition of Bohemia has been proposed and has rapidly become popular.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50444;Treaty of Szekesféhervar Negotiations;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50444;The War of Hungarian Independence has finished, and we have been defeated. All parties, even us, have agreed to meet at the royal hunting estate outside of Szekesféhervar to negotiate the details. A partition of our kingdom has been proposed and has rapidly become popular.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50445;Treaty of Szekesféhervar Signing;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50445;Negotiations proceeded, and the idea of a partition of Bohemia has made it into the treaty. Hungary and her allies will be given neighbouring provinces of Bohemia, whose territory will be reduced to the city of Prague and surrounding countryside. Furthermore, the monarchy, which proved to be unpopular even in Bohemia and Moravia during the war, will be expelled from the new free city. Instead, a democratic government will be installed in the cultural and geographic heart of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50446;Treaty of Szekesféhervar Signing;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50446;Negotiations on the treaty proceeded, and alas, the idea of a partition of our country has made into the document. Hungary and her allies will be given border provinces from our kingdom, reducing our territory to just the city of Prague and surrounding countryside. Furthermore, our monarchy, because of some propaganda about small-scale unrest we experienced during the war, will be banished from the city. Instead, a democratic government will be installed in the cultural and geographic heart of Europe.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50447;Treaty of Szekesféhervar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50447;The Treaty of Szekesféhervar, signed in $YEAR$, affirmed the independence of Hungary from Bohemia and saw the dismantlement of the fledgling empire. Its neighbours, long tired of its machinations and seeking to expand their own holdings, were all too quick to agree when the partition was proposed by Silesian first minister Jan Kozdon. The territory of the Kingdom of Bohemia was thus reduced to only Prague and the surrounding countryside, with Austria, Brandenburg, Bavaria, Silesia, and Hungary making significant territorial gains in Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia. The Bohemian monarchy, the von Escherlochs, was banished from the region, and took up residence in Mauguio in Aquitània. A democracy was established in the city-state, which was designated the Free City of Prague.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50448;Defeat in the Hungarian Rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50448;Despite our best efforts, we could not put down the rebels in Hungary. They worked in concert with former allies to cut us down and have now decided to unjustly seize that which is not theirs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50450;The Treaty Takes Effect;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50450;Per the terms of the Treaty of Szekesféhervar, we must now expel the monarchy, adopt a constitution and democratic government. We will now be called the Free City of Prague, and must disavow any aggression against the victors.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50451;Influence in Austria;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50451;Over the years, the Crown of Bohemia and Duchy of Austria have fought against each other and have banded to face threats from the east: the Hungarians, the Armenians, even the Romans. These threats have diminished, and so, too, has our formerly close relationship with our neighbour to the southwest. We should rekindle the flames of friendship with the Austrians and renew the once-close bond we had.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50452;Austrian Influence;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50452;We have always had a close cultural and linguistic connection with our kin in Österreich, though we have neglected it in recent years since the debacle with the Imperial War. We should reassess our relationship and extend them our fraternal hand of friendship to restore the formerly close relations we once had.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50453;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Pushes its Agenda in Austria;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50453;Recently, diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been attempting to ingratiate Austria in a move which would increase their sway over the Duchy at the expense of ours. We cannot allow them to sway the opinion of the Austrians away from us!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50454;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Seemingly Withdraws from Austrian Affaris;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50454;Our diplomats in Austria report having seen little of their counterparts from $FROMCOUNTRY$ recently, and rumours in Austrian diplomatic circles, corroborated by our intelligence network, suggest that they have decided to more or less abandon Austria to us, for one reason or another. Regardless, we should now have a permanent leg up in affairs in the Duchy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50455;Pospíšil's Hats;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50455;A Prague hatmaker has recently gained international fame after getting orders from the King of Aengland, the Duke of Brabant, and the King of Hispania all in the same month! His hats, ironically called Malechkis, come to be worn by nobility and the rich alike in the coming century. Truly, Prague is the center of art, culture, and fashion in Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50456;Premiere of the Carpathian Dances;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50456;Bohemian composer Jan Hollenburg traveled extensively in the eastern end of the kingdom in the mid-1830s and collected folk songs. After years of toil, he has performed his now-famous orchestral renderings of these collected songs. In a concert attended by the king himself, Hollenburg amazed the audience and ended the performance to raucous cheering from the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50457;The Marticek Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50457;A painting has been unveiled of Father Czech, the mythological founder of Bohemia. Eduard Marticek was commissioned by the cousin of the King to paint this work, but the problem is that Father Czech bears the likeness of the cousin himself, Count Ladislaus. The church and much of the court immediately denounced him for this stunt, but it has attracted attention both from the general public and from abroad.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50458;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Asks to Join $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50458;The rulers of $FROMCOUNTRY$ are Hungarian, and seeing our successful bid for independence and the power we displayed at the treaty negotiations, they wish to be part of our great country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50459;Ladislaus Dies in Exile;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50459;After becoming a republic of the people and expelling the von Escherlochs from our country, they went to Aquitània to live out their lives in exile. Today, the disgraced and elderly former king of Bohemia, Ladislaus IV, died at the age of 72. He is remembered for having brought Hungary under the Bohemian crown and overseen industrialisation and growth in our country. However, his skills in foreign affairs were lacking, and his stubborn refusal to grant more power to the people in the face of his own mediocrity in domestic affairs culminated in rebellions and, finally, the downfall of the monarchy. Despite this, monarchists all over $COUNTRY$ will take off their hats today to mourn him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50460;King Ladislaus Dies;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50460;Having guided Bohemia through difficult years of Albesan and Hungarian uprisings, our king, Ladislaus IV, died today at the ripe old age of 71. His efforts to industrialise the country, expand infrastructure and the military, and secure $COUNTRY$ against any threats earned him a good deal of love from his subjects, even if many believed that more power needed to go to the people because of his occasional missteps. Still, the general consensus is that $COUNTRY$ profited from his rule, and all now hope that his son, Jindric Petr, will be a strong ruler to protect $COUNTRY$ in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50461;Bohemian Partisans;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50461;Local Czechs in land we acquired in the Treaty of Szekesfehervar have risen up and attacked our officials and disrupted trade and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ business. In one recent incident, a group of our soldiers were just down the road. They ran for the scene of the fight as soon as they heard gunfire, but by the time they arrived, the bandits had disappeared. They left a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchant dead on the road. These events will continue to happen. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50462;Prague Supports Partisans;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50462;Our spies have done some digging after a raid on a partisan hideout turned up some interesting documents. It seems that certain higher-ups in the military and government of the city-state of Prague have been funding these bandits. This is an act of war and must be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50463;The End of the Hungarian Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50463;A jubilant military parade in Budapest.\n\n We have defeated the Hungarian rebels. The provisional government they set up in Budapest has been captured and its leaders, among whom was counted Count Orczy, have been executed. The situation has been defused, and there is peace once more in Bohemia.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50464;Lease Zadar Again?;x
EVTDESC50464;The government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us, requesting a renewal of the lease of the port of Zadar, which we originally leased them all those years ago. Will we accept?;x
EVTNAME50465;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Turns Down the Offer;x
EVTDESC50465;Alas, they have decided that Zadar is too valuable to them, and have refused to lease the port to us. Unfortunately, it seems that, if we wish to have access to Mediterranean port facilities, it will only be by acquiring land by force.;x
EVTNAME50494;Time to Make a Payment;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50494;Another year has passed, and Bohemia must now make its annual payment of 5000 to Croatia for the Zadar lease. Only four payments remain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50495;Another year has passed, and Bohemia must now make its annual payment of 5000 to Croatia for the Zadar lease. Only three payments remain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50496;Another year has passed, and Bohemia must now make its annual payment of 5000 to Croatia for the Zadar lease. Only two payments remain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50497;Another year has passed, and Bohemia must now make its annual payment of 5000 to Croatia for the Zadar lease. Only one payment remains.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50498;The Final Zadar Payment Comes Due;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50498;The last payment for the lease of Zadar is now due.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50499;Croatia Cancels Zadar Lease;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50499;Now that we have lost Hungary, we have also lost our access points to the railway we built to Zadar. Because of this, Croatia has decided to cancel our lease of the port...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50500;Duke Frederick VII of Holsten Dies!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50500;The beloved Duke of the house of Adolfensborg has died childless at the old age of 74. His only son, Christian, perished in the Atlantic while serving in the Danish Royal Navy in 1826, and the Duke was never the same again. His wife, the Duchess Margerit, died shortly thereafter, presumably of grief, and he never remarried. Instead, he dedicated himself to the good of his subjects, building hospitals and other infrastructure, and using his wealth to aid the poor and develop the economy of the Duchy. He will be missed. And because he died childless, the Duchy of Holsten now falls into the demesne of the King of Denmark, Erik IV.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50502;Expansion of the Ombunduland Colony;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50502;The directors of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Africa Company have approached the government asking for aid in establishing formal posts inland from Lobito and Skredsvig. Iron has apparently been discovered in an area not far away, and the company and $COUNTRY$ could profit from these discoveries, and others that may come later. If we give them our support, the company will no doubt be able to establish more trading posts and improve our control over the territories than if they work alone.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50503;Lybæk Returned to Our Hands;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50503;Having lost this important port to the Germans once before, we have now reclaimed the city, and should once again call it by its proper name, Lybæk. All is now right in this part of our country.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50504;Stirrings of Latvian Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50504;The Latvian peoples in the southern marches are distinct from most of the peoples of our empire. Their language and customs are strange to us, although they have adopted some of our ways. They have been swayed by liberal and nascent nationalist movements across Europe and are beginning to clamour for rights and concessions that are distinctively Latvian. There's talk of schooling, self-government, and the chronicling of folk tales - all in Latvian. As the movement gains strength and support, it will no doubt make the region a more volatile and difficult place to govern, but their lands belong in our empire.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50505;Latvian Rebellion!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50505;Liberal and nationalist Latvians have broken out in riots across Latvia and even in major centres of the Proper territories. Storefronts have been smashed, government offices raided. In Latvia itself, Finns and Estonians have been attacked by more militant crowds. Even now, the rebels are arming themselves and preparing to fight Finnish troops, should we send them to put a stop to the violence.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50506;Return Lybæk to $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50506;A diplomat has arrived from the recently unified country inquiring about the status of our port city, which has a significant German population and which has recently expressed interest in joining the country. The city could become a flashpoint for conflict between our two countries, and this conflict would definitely favour $FROMCOUNTRY$. What shall we tell the diplomat?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50507;Reply from $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50507;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ reply stated that they would be willing to sell us Lübeck for a sum of 25000. Will we accept?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50508;$FROMCOUNTRY$: "No.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50508;They have decided that they do not want to part with Lübeck.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50509;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50509;They have paid us the requested sum and we should now cede the city to them.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50510;$FROMCOUNTRY$: "Too high.";;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50510;The reply has come from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that the price we're asking is too high. We could lower the asking price to 15000, or just leave the deal altogether.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50511;A Lower Price?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50511;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have consented to lowering the asking price to a more reasonable 15000. Will we accept?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50512;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Backs Out;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50512;They have withdrawn from negotiations because we wouldn't accept the initial price. They were unwilling to go lower. How unfortunate. We won't have another chance to negotiate.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50513;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50513;The Germans have accepted the lower price we proposed. At least we got something out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50514;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Walks Away;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50514;The Germans have backed out of negotiations, stating that they were unwilling to pay even the reduced price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50515;Defeat in the War!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50515;The damned Swedes have succeeded in reclaiming Skåne and are now pushing us to renounce any claims to the province. The Norwegians have offered to mediate and we have been invited to Anslo to negotiate the armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50516;Victory!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50516;We have defeated the Danes and reclaimed what land is rightfully ours. The Norwegians have invited us and the Danes to Anslo to negotiate a treaty.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50517;The $YEAR$ Treaty of Anslo;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50517;When the 3rd Skåne War finished in $YEAR$, Norway offered to help mediate between its squabbling cousins. It was decided that Skåne would remain definitively in the hands of the Swedes, and in exchange, they would not prey on Danish colonies in Africa. Of course, the Danes were in no position to negotiate, but the fact of the matter is that peace was achieved and the Skåne Question would be put to rest for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50518;When the 3rd Skåne War finished in $YEAR$, Norway offered to help mediate between its squabbling cousins. It was decided that Skåne would remain definitively in the hands of the Danes following the defeat of the Swedes, with nothing gained by the latter. Indeed, the Swedish delegation was forced to accept the humiliation of publicly relinquishing their claims on the territory. But it would remain to be seen if the Skåne Question would truly be put to rest.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50520;The Fate of Skåne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50520;With the defeat of $FROMCOUNTRY$ in the war and peace restored, world powers have agreed that all aggressors should be punished for their warmongering. $FROMCOUNTRY$ will not be spared, and Skåne has been a topic of intense debate. Many of the members from the delegations of the various victors are proposing the idea of a Free Territory of Skåne as an answer to peace in the region. But Skåne is our territory, is it not? The general consensus is to create an independent territory overseen by the victors, but we may yet change that outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50521;The Skåne Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50521;Being a territory which has been squabbled over for decades - if not centuries - between Sweden and Denmark, Skåne has long been a source of tension and conflict in the region. With its current owner now defeated, the peace conference must decide what to do in order to prevent such a war again. The current mood among the delegates is to create an internationally-recognised Free Territory in the region, but $FROMCOUNTRY$ would be pleased if they received it.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50522;Skåne to be Released!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50522;The victors in the peace conference have decided to punish us unjustly by forcing us to release Skåne. It will be a Free Territory under the guardianship of the victorious powers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50523;Skåne Returned;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50523;The peace conference saw fit to return to us our rightful territory. A day of celebration will be held throughout all of $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50524;Skåne Made Independent;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50524;The peace conference saw fit to release Skåne as a Free Territory under international supervision. This means, of course, that we will not have control over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50525;A Midnight Raid?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50525;Our sources in $PROVINCENAME$ have told us that there is a secret meetinghouse for Latvian nationalists in the province. The traitors who frequent it are using it to foment rebellion against our benevolent rule! By ordering the police to shut down this place, we will surely nip any Latvian trouble in the bud.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50526;Successful Suppression;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50526;Our raid in $PROVINCENAME$ was a complete success! The ringleaders in the building were rounded up and imprisoned. Our police even discovered a school inside teaching Latvian. Who knows why the children were studying so late at night, but they have been sent to loyal families to get a proper education. This bud has been nipped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50527;Backfire!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50527;When our police kicked down the door of the meetinghouse, they found a school inside, and one of our men inadvertently killed a child. News about the incident is passing quickly in the local community and outrage is spreading like wildfire throughout Latvia.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50528;Latvian Fraternal Society;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50528;Local informants in $PROVINCENAME$ have given us intelligence on the foundation and expansion of a local chapter of a fraternal society devoted to Latvian independence. They have begun teaching the language, recording and spreading local tales, and hosting discussions and debates on the different kinds of ways of resisting our benevolent rule.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50529;Latvia Free!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50529;The Latvians have won their freedom, and we can no longer claim to rule over them.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50530;Intervention in Latvia?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50530;The Latvians continue their struggle for freedom from the Finnish yoke. We have been supporting their movement for some time. Some of their representatives have now approached us, asking if we would be willing to take a more direct approach in aiding them, promising eternal friendship and perhaps even some concessions further down the line.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50590;Kesäillan Valssi;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50590;As the waltz took $COUNTRYNAME$ by storm in the end of the 19th century, $COUNTRYADJ$ composers were quick to take it up, and soon their compositions spread throughout the waltzing courts and estates of Europe.\n\nThis piece, "A Summernight's Waltz," soon became the preferred song at balls in $COUNTRY$ and abroad. Toivo Kilpinen, already a rising star in the world of $COUNTRYADJ$ composition, rocketed to international fame with the 1888 debute of this piece. He personally conducted it touring Europe in 1889 and 1890, bringing $COUNTRY$ into the exclusive circle of countries of art and culture.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50600;Anatole Reclaimed!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50600;After its loss in 1813 after the Peace of Amasea, we have at long last regained our rightful land in Anatole. The themes of Anatolikon and Boukellarion are once again wholly ours! We have come to found a land which is full of both Roman citizens and Muslims. The communities are sharply divided following the religious strife that began with our reconquest in the late 18th century. In time, we must decide how to address this state of affairs, which will lead only to greater conflict. For now, we can rejoice in our victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50601;Death of Autokrator Isaakius;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50601;Isaakius IV breathed his last breath today, dying at the age of 58 in his sleep in the Boukoleon Palace which he restored to its former glory. Internationally known for his successful wars against the Armenians, his real passion was architecture, which he studied after completing his term of service in the Imperial Army. During his reign, which began in 1819, he oversaw many construction and restoration projects in the city. He will now rest with his Melisurgos ancestors in the Imperial Tombs next to the Hagia Sophia. Isaakius' son, Ioannes, has been crowned Autokrator.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50602;Evangelos Melisurgos promoted to General;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50602;The brother of Ioannes, heir to the throne of the Empire, has recently been promoted to General. Already having gained fame for a particularly valiant assault on an Armenian position outside of Caesarea, he is now given the rank to command an entire army.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50603;Greek City Councils Send a Message;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50603;Under the leadership of Athanasius Dioskoros, a prominent landholder in Attica, city councils throughout the Greek peninsula have sent petitions to the Emperor's representative in Athens and to Constantinople itself. There have been dissident, secessionist grumblings, demanding greater freedom, lower taxes, and more say in regional and national goings-on. Such traitorous talk has not been heard in Greece in centuries!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50604;Nationalist Insurrection in Bulgaria;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50604;The Bulgarians have always had close ties with the Hungarians and Serbs, and liberal ideas have filtered through these two peoples and have in the past couple of decades taken root in Bulgaria. They have increasingly tied liberal ideas to nationalism, and despite having been Imperial citizens more or less continuously for a millennium, are now seeking secession. Riots and rebellions have broken out in towns and cities throughout the Bulgarian themes. How should we respond to this chaos?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50605;Secessionist Rebellion in Arbenon;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50605;The Arbens have always lived in a world apart from the rest of the Empire, occupying a mountainous, isolated portion of the coast. They have also remained highly tribal, though at times, these primitive groupings have put aside their differences to work together for a common cause. Now is such a time, as the head of the largest tribe of the Ghegs, Izet Dragoti, as united most Arbens in seeking freedom from taxes and military service. They don't seem to realise that taxes and military service are for their own good! How should we respond to this insult to the Empire?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50606;Death of Autokrator Ioannes;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50606;Ioannes XI died of tuberculosis on this day, leaving his 15 year-old son, Georgios III, as his heir. In the midst of the troubles in the Balkans and Armenian revanchism, the Empire is facing many challenges without a capable leader.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50607;Evangelos Attempts a Coup;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50607;Ioannes' younger brother, Evangelos, is an exceedingly famous and well-liked general who took part in the reconquest of Anatole. As such, he is very popular with the citizens of Anatolia. Today, he appeared at the Boukoleon Palace with a few men yesterday evening while Autokrator Georgios III was dining with his siblings. The guards outside the room were murdered, but Evangelos was unable to gain access to it thanks to quick-thinking guards inside and a patrol. He escaped in the confusion and is believed to have left the city. Georgios is unharmed, but shaken by the event. \n\n(At this time, Anatolia is released as a vassal so as to give them a chance to gather their army. That way there isn't a silly situation like with the ACW in vanilla.);;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50608;The Roman Succession War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50608;When Ioannes XI died of tuberculosis in 1858, the Roman Empire was already a tinderbox, ready to explode into chaos at any moment. The liberal revolution and the "Springtime of Nations" that followed it hit the ancient empire hard. Greeks, Bulgarians, and Arbens all demanded greater autonomy, with mixed reactions from the Empire, which had never faced nationalist troubles on this scale from peoples who had been Imperial citizens for a millennium. With discontent still high and tensions with Armenia over Anatolia, many felt that the new Autokrator, 15 year-old Georgios III, was not the right choice to guide the Empire through times that seemed to be a repeat of the Red Years. After a failed coup attempt, Georgios' uncle, Evangelos, an exceedingly popular general, has fled to the recently-reconquered themes of Anatolia, where he has a power base. He has now raised his armies and declared his intention to claim the Roman throne for himself. Meanwhile, the increasingly intransigent Greeks have ceased sending tribute and troops. What will become of the Second Rome?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50610;Greek Productivity Collapses!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50610;Local councils charged with collecting taxes and goods have recently been failing to deliver what they previously have. Up to this point, official inquiries have failed to turn up any reason for this. Even more concerning, there have been a number of attacks against royal officials and offices, soldiers not appearing for duty, and other problems. In short, there seems to be a general state of disorder, but surely it will pass, as it always takes time for the people to accustom themselves to a new ruler.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50611;Crete and Cyprus Cease Contributing;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50611;It has now been over three months since the last shipment of goods, taxes, and soldiers from the islands of Crete and Cyprus. Today, telegrams arrived from both Irakleio and Lemesus declaring their intention to seek their own paths and prosperity. They cited the increasing instability in the empire and their trading ambitions as key factors in their decision and requested that the Empire respect their sovereignty. Will we abide by their request?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50612;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Offers Aid;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50612;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to us to offer military aid in our wars. But there's a catch. Instead of the autonomy they have now, they want full independence when the war is settled. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50614;Moldavia Prepares for War!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50614;The Hospodar of Moldavia, Dumitru Gradisteanu, has been rallying his people and intends to take advantage of the difficulties the Empire is experiencing to unite the Volasean peoples of Wallachia and Moldavia. He has vowed to do it by force, if necessary. As the Hospodar of Wallachia is still loyal to us and is our vassal, it is up to us to help him defend his people. Will the Empire uphold its commitment and duty to Wallachia?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50615;The Empire will not back down;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50615;Autokrator Georgios III is aware of our preparations and intentions regarding Wallachia and Volasea. They have informed us that they will not stand idly by while we 'take advantage of their difficulties.' We are now faced with a hard decision: War against the Empire, hobbled as it is, or a loss of face among our people and all Volaseans.;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50616;The Empire Accedes to our Demands;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50616;Having made Autokrator Georgios III aware of our plans and ambitions, he has wisely elected to avoid conflict with us, expressing his wish to maintain an amicable relationship. The Empire will not contest us if we attempt to unite Volasea.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50617;The Empire has released us!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50617;With the difficulties the Empire is having at the moment, and politics with Hospodar Gradisteanu in Iasi, Autokrator Georgios III has elected to release us from our vassalage so as to avoid any conflict on his northern border. It is likely that Gradisteanu will ask us to submit to his will, or he will bring war upon us. Still, we now have control over our own fate!;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50618;The Empire Washes its Hands of Volasea;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50618;Autokrator Georgios III and his council have decided to abandon us and withdraw entirely from involvement in Wallachia and Moldavia. And this after our long friendship and loyalty! If he is so quick to abandon us when faced with troubles, then perhaps we are better off without the Empire!;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50620;Moldavia Proposes Unification;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50620;Now that we are free from the Empire, which has also decided to not involve itself in any Moldavian actions toward us. Moldavia's Gradisteanu has sent us a proposal: We join him in a unified Volasea, for the good and glory of all Volaseans!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50624;Moldavia is defeated!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50624;Hospodar Gradisteanu and the Moldavian Principality have been defeated. We defended Wallachia even in our times of trouble, and now we have to decide what to do with Moldavia.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50625;We are repaid for our loyalty!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50625;After our involvement in the war against Moldavia and our friendship and loyalty with the Empire, Autokrator Georgios III has decided to grant us overlordship of Moldavia, and has elevated us to a Kingdom of Volasea!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50626;Moldavia is Victorious!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50626;We have been defeated and Wallachia is shackled by Hospodar Gradisteanu. This is an embarrassing day for the Empire...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50627;The Succession War is Over!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50627;Our armies have defeated the traitor, Evangelos Melisurgos, and smashed his armies. The rebel Anatolians have been put down and peace has been restored. Evangelos will be executed later today, and is kept under very close guard. His allies are gone. Let prosperity return to the Empire once more!;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50628;We are victorious!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50628;Under the leadership of Evangelos Melisurgos, who has now crowned himself Evangelos I, Autokrator of Rome. Our armies conquered Constantinople, but Georgios escaped. Where to, we don't know, but for now, we are safe, and we can focus on rebuilding the Empire under the leadership of a strong Autokrator.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50629;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Reminds us of our Promise;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50629;At the beginning of the Succession War, $FROMCOUNTRY$ offered to aid us in exchange for a promise of true independence after the war. They have been citizens of the Empire for many ages. Will we uphold our promise and allow them to become completely independent?;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50630;The Empire has Refused to Honour their Promise!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50630;Georgios III has refused to uphold his end of the bargain we made at the start of the Succession War. He has stated that we will remain Imperial subjects after all.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50631;Greece Rises in Revolt!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50631;A coordinated rebellion has begun in Greece, led, apparently by a "Council of Revolutionaries". Unsurprisingly, its head is Athanasius Dioskoros, a prominent landholder in Attica, and these upstarts intend to transform Greece into a democratic republic. They have the ridiculous idea of a government of the people by the people for the people. How shall we respond to this lunacy?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50632;Roman Chronika;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50632;On this day, the 1500th year since the sundering of the Roman Empire in two, the renowned historian and academician, Aris Solomas, published his epic work on the history of the Roman Empire. The most comprehensive work on the subject ever written, it spanned nearly three dozen volumes and took over twenty years to compose. The monumental work quickly found its way into university libraries across the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME50633;Police Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50633;Recent unrest has spurred the government to review the way domestic order is maintained. Until now, policing was very much an ad hoc affair, with laws being enforced selectively and such power being in the hands of nepotistic and opportunistic men. It has been decided to reform and professionalise the police, using the Noumeroi of Constantinople as an example. There shall now be more stringent requirements and training for police officers, whose duties and organisational structure shall be codified and uniform for the entire country.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50634;Roman Stalemate;x
EVTDESC50634;With the inability of either side in the Roman Succession War to gain the upper hand, a temporary truce has been concluded so as to allow both sides to conduct some urgent affairs. This has caused the Empire and Autokrator Georgios III to lose face significantly, and has lent some legitimacy to Melisurgos' cause. It is only a matter of time until war breaks out again, however. Perhaps then will there be a sure end to this tragedy.;x
EVTNAME50637;Imperial Integration;x
EVTDESC50637;Our vassal is increasingly allowing our administrators to aid them in their governance, and their people increasingly come to see themselves as citizens of the Empire despite their nominal independence. It is time to reduce bureaucratic obstacles to good governance and rule them directly from Constantinople.;x
EVTNAME50680;The End of Armenian Anatolia;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50680;It has been years since Armenia has controlled the now-Roman themes of Anatolikon and Boukellarion. We have suffered losses at the hands of the Romans and don't have the power or international standing to contest them anymore. Armenian Anatolia is lost to us.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50689;Restoration of the Pentarchy;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50689;For countless centuries, the old Pentarchy of the ancient Roman Empire has been but a footnote in the history books. It represented the authority of the Christian religion in all of the eastern Mediterranean. We now control all five of the original seats of the Pentarchy, and we can restore it. Followers of Orthodoxy all over the world will rejoice at the symbolism of their religion's newfound place in the world.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50690;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Wishes to Join our Republic;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50690;Given the inevitable threat from the Roman Empire or some successor state, and the prosperity which all can see in our future, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided that it would be prudent and advantageous to join our fledgling trade republic.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50691;Irakleio Invites us to Join their Republic;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50691;The rising star of the Mediterranean has sent an offer to us. By joining their republic, they claim that both parties would profit.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50692;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses our Offer!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50692;The response from $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not what we hoped: They have turned us down. This is disappointing, but not the end of the world, after all.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50800;A Venetian Celebration;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50800;The city of Venice recently celebrated its 1500th birthday. The city was traditionally founded on March 25, 421. Crowds gathered in St. Mark's Square and other parts of the city to join in the celebrations.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50801;A Serial Killer?!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50801;Police have been dealing with a rash of murders in $PROVINCENAME$. They appear to be connected, and the populace is starting to panic. So far, police have few leads, and are appealing for calm.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50802;Serial Killer Strikes Again!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50802;This murderer continues to make headlines in $PROVINCENAME$ and countrywide with yet another slaying! When will he be caught?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50803;Serial Killer Caught!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50803;At long last, $PROVINCENAME$ is safe at night, as the serial killer who has been plaguing it for months has at last been caught! A high society man, he has been sent to the local insane asylum, since he poses a threat to others in the prison.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50804;The Great $PROVINCENAME$ Fire;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50804;A massive conflagration has destroyed much of the city in $PROVINCENAME$, despite the best efforts of the firefighters. Images are emerging of destitute commoners wandering about a charred and smoking mess of a city, and the government must decide how to respond to this catastrophe.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50805;Potenza Earthquake;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50805;In December of 1857, a massive earthquake struck the $COUNTRYADJ$ province of Potenza, causing severe damage and killing thousands. It would prompt the Aquitànian Royal Academy of Sciences to launch an effort to understand earthquakes as a means of learning to predict them better.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50806;Avezzano Earthquake;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50806;In January of 1915, Avezzano, in the province of Aquila in the Abruzzo region, was struck by one of the strongest in the region's history. Tens of thousands of died, and the cities of Avezzano and Aquila were leveled. Shaking and damage were reported as far away as Rome, Bologna, and Naples.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50809;Eyjafjallajokul's Legacy;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50809;The eruption of that volcano in 1837 darkened skies across Europe and resulted in the greatest famine in recent memory on the continent. As the skies clear and temperatures climb once more, a sense of normalcy is beginning to return, and hitherto upset peasants and city-dwellers are once again going about their everyday business of producing - not agitating against the government. We have weathered the storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50810;Automation and the Peasantry;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC50810;The invention and popularisation of the threshing machine caused headaches for governments throughout the world. Previously, threshing was done by hand in a laborious and time-consuming manner. The adoption of mechanised means of accomplishing the same task meant that fewer hands were needed in the field. Idle hands are the devil's plaything, as the old saying goes. And so, there were riots and unemployment in the first half of the 19th century as many farm labourers struggled to adjust and found themselves out of work. While in some countries, they were successfully moved to new arable land, in others they moved into the cities, with attendant issues regarding crime and overcrowding. Our country is now facing this problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50811;Bet with the Duke of Pomerania?;x
EVTDESC50811;The Duke of our neighbouring duchy is convinced that Russia will win in its current war against Smolensk, despite the odds. We stand to win a bit of money making the easy bet.;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME50812;The Bet is On!;x
EVTDESC50812;The Duke of Mecklenburg has agreed to our wager. We will eagerly await the results of the war.;x
EVTNAME50813;No Bet;x
EVTDESC50813;The Duke of Mecklenburg actually agrees with us about this war. Oh well!;x
EVTNAME50814;Russian victory;x
EVTDESC50814;The Russians have won against all odds - and so have we! It took some time to convince the Duke to pay out, but we have our winnings.;x
EVTNAME50815;Smolensk victory;x
EVTDESC50815;The Smolenskii Knyaz has won - and so have we! It was an easy bet, and it took some time for the Duke to pay out, but we have now received our winnings and some bragging rights.;x
EVTNAME50816;The Duke of Pomerania's Bet;x
EVTDESC50816;With the recent conclusion of the war between Smolensk and Russia, it has been made known in the circles of the nobility that the Duke of Pomerania wagered on the outcome with the Duke of Mecklenburg. The result surprised everyone.;x
EVTNAME50817;Eyjafjallajokul erupts!;x
EVTDESC50817;With the eruption of the volcano in Iceland, it's only a matter of time until the great ash clouds reach us. We are should expect for a bad year or two of harvests because of it. This will make life even more difficult for the peasantry.;x
EVTNAME50818;Our Lady of Lorda;x
EVTDESC50818;In 1858 in Lorda, province of Pau, a young Bernadeta Sobirós witnessed an apparition of the Mother Mary consistently over the course of several months in a grotto in the hills. After much national debate, the Church has finally stepped in and the Pope himself has come and performed a Canonical Coronation, signalling official support for the veneration of Our Lady of Lourdes. The spring which Bernadeta uncovered has been proven to have caused numerous healings among pilgrims to the site;x
EVTNAME50819;Canonization of Bernadeta Sobirós;x
EVTDESC50819;On this day, the girl who had visions of the Mother Mary all those years ago in 1858 is declared a Saint. This will only increase the flow of pilgrims to Lorda.;x
EVTNAME51000;The Iroquois and Cherokee Break Away!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51000;Our long-time friends and brothers to our north and south have seen fit to take advantage of our momentary weakness after fighting against the whiteskins to seek their fortunes without our aid or protection. It is truly a misfortune that they should forsake the friendship our great tribes have had for generations.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51001;The Solelha Purchase;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51001;Aquitània has approached us with a proposition. They would like to sell their colony which borders our territory, Solelha, for a sum of 25000. Is Margaria interested?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51002;Margaria Agrees to Buy Solelha;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51002;They have assented to the price of 25000 and will transfer it to us forthwith.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51003;Margaria Declines to Buy Solelha;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51003;Citing financial and political concerns, the Margarian government decided not to buy our colony.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51004;Pioneers in the Sierra Madre;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51004;As our nation expands northward and westward, our brave pioneers have come into conflict several times with Califianan settlers pushing east. In this harsh land, disagreements over the limited water and natural resources available is inevitable. Some in our government have suggested that we should use our military not only to enforce our claims in the Sierra Madre, but to take the sparsely populated land of Califiana for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51005;The Ginnaecerisc Proposal;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51005;An interesting proposal has come to us from our cousins to the south in Ginnaecer. They report that war with Califiana is looking increasingly likely, and the victor will likely take all of the Amerigan southwest for themselves. If we join Ginnaecer in the coming war, we will likely win - and be entitled to the northern Califianan lands for our troubles!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51200;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Offers to Buy Our Colonies;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51200;A delegation from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed to buy our colonies of Porterei and Nova Bordeu. Will we accept their offer?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51201;Aquitània Agrees to the Sale;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51201;They have agreed to our offer to buy their colonies. It is truly a great day for $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51202;Aquitània Refuses the Sale;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51202;The Aquitànians have decided to not sell their land to us, after all.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51203;We have lost our South Amerigan colonies;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51203;Now that we no longer control Porterei and Nova Bordeu, and haven't for years, we cannot maintain our claim on these former colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51400;Bar and Lorraine Subjugated;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51400;With the defeat of the dukes of Bar and Lorraine, and their territory being returned to us, their power is broken. They will no longer be able to claim independent rule of these lands, which are, of course, rightfully French.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51450;$FROMCOUNTRY$ and the Window to the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51450;$FROMCOUNTRY$, seeking to expand its influence and even perhaps project into the Baltic, has approached us with an offer: a cash infusion and continued support in our economy and military in exchange. This is, of course, almost certainly not merely a charitable donation. It is clear that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s would expect to have significant clout within $THIS$, which should in and of itself be viewed with suspicion. It is no secret that they wish to have a port in the Baltic for the own purposes, and it should be plain that their idea is to use our country to that end if this deal goes through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51451;Aid for Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51451;Our Baltic neighbour has accepted our aid, and has now invited us into the country to make good on our promises to modernise and improve their military and economy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51452;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses our Overture;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51452;The government of $FROMCOUNTRY$, suspicious of our motives - and rightly so -, have decided to turn down our generous offer. Because of their suspicions, they have also decided to publish knowledge of this private offer abroad, and our action has drawn harsh criticism from the other Great Powers and nearby countries. As our motivations are now more or less revealed, perhaps it would be best to strike while the iron is hot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51453;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Influence Grows;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51453;The power of $FROMCOUNTRY$'s military and economic advisors has grown to the point that they are beginning to attempt to run our country for us! Indeed, we have heard rumours of a plot to overthrow the government! The conspirators are highly placed and it is highly likely that they would call on their backers if we were to move against them.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51454;Control over $FROMCOUNTRY$;x
EVTDESC51454;Our policy of infiltration has begun to pay off. $FROMCOUNTRY$ is increasingly relying on the advisors we have sent, whether it is because they need them or because of the implication of what would happen if they did not. We shall shortly have men placed in the highest parts of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, and they will thereafter follow our orders.;x
EVTNAME51455;Our Advisors Expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$!;x
EVTDESC51455;The government in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been well aware of our true motives for some time, it seems, and now they have decided to make an attempt, however feeble, to resist us. If we still wish to gain our Window to the West there, it seems that force is now the only option available to us. If we do not act on this now, we will never have such a justification or opportunity to do this again.;x
EVTNAME51456;Closer Integration with $FROMCOUNTRY$;x
EVTDESC51456;Today, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government agreed to a proposal by our ambassador to accept greater integration with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state. They will enjoy a privileged status in our country in return. A Baltic breeze shall now wash over $COUNTRY_ADJ$!;x
EVTNAME51500;Death of the Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51500;Sultan Ali Thani Jalamuddin died today of old age. A cunning diplomat, he insured the survival of the Sultanate when the Europeans came in force in the 1820s, negotiating a fair treaty that granted Aengland access to the country while securing the rights and privileges of its people. His son, the new sultan, Badr Thani, is suspicious of the Aenglisc and despises the way their merchants treat his people. Already, he has jailed one such merchant and barred them from entering the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51501;The Sultan of Aceh Dies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51501;Sultan Ali Thani Jalamuddin died recently of old age. A cunning diplomat, he negotiated a treaty that granted us access to the country, a move that was criticised by his court. His son, the new sultan, Badr Thani, is suspicious of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and despises the way our merchants do business. Already, he has jailed one such merchant and barred them from entering the capital. He represents a serious threat to our interests in the region. It seems that establishing direct control of the Sultanate is the only option we have, if we want to maintain our position in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Dares Threaten Us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51502;A message from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived, demanding that we bow to them. They contend that the Sultan's attitude and actions are in direct violation of the treaty and its spirit signed by his father. They want to establish direct control over the Sultanate, and promise to use military force if necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51503;The Sulawesi Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51503;Rebels have recently challenged Sultan Hasanuddin in Sulawesi, and unrest has begun to spread to our holdings on the island. With our economic interests at stake in the region, and always under threat from the Dutch, Albannach, and Aenglisc, we should find a way to put a stop to the chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51504;Alba's Colonies up for Grabs;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51504;Aengland has all but defeated Alba and forced them into submission. With the loss of their home territories and naval support, Alba's colonies in Indonesia are vulnerable. This would be the perfect chance for $COUNTRY$ to gain some more territory and resources to exploit. While Aengland has claimed all of them, they don't have the means to stop us from taking what we want.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51505;The Fate of Alba's Colonies;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51505;With the final defeat of Alba, it's time to put our plans into action and claim their Indonesian colonies for $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51509;Albannach Cleanup;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51509;If there are any Albannach colonies remaining in the world, we will hunt them down and claim them for $COUNTRY$. Let us leave no stone unturned!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51600;The Revolution Arrives at our Doorstep;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51600;Inspired by the success in Aquitània and elsewhere in Europe, our unruly people, swayed by traitorous Albesans, have come to believe they have the right to take our lives, our lands, and our power. They do not remember our benevolent rule, but are goaded on by empty promises. A military expedition from the Aquitànian Republic has arrived in Grenoblo and they have drawn a large mob, which has surrounded the Palace and gathered in Plaça Sant-André. The message is clear: acquiesce to the will of the people or drown in the sea of savage, unwashed masses.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51650;Corsican Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51650;The wave of liberalism sweeping the continent has washed over the islands. Today, a crowd demanding rights and concessions overran the guards at the palace and dragged the Duke and Duchess out, flogging them. Intellectuals and literary figures from the islands have installed a provisional government in the capital.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51651;A Claim on the Maretan Islands?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51651;The Maretan people of the islands of Corsica and Sardinia have long been part of the same cultural sphere as our people have. The language is fairly similar and their customs are, too. With their ouster of the monarchy, it falls to us to restore order to the people, and we could use this as an excuse to bring the islands under our wing politically, too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51652;A Delegation from $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51652;Officially styled the Republic of Corsica and Sardinia, delegates have arrived in Mauguio to make a proposal to the National Council and all of our republic: an official declaration of eternal friendship and alliance between our two freedom-loving peoples, so that we may mutually prosper. We could use this to exert more control over the western Mediterranean, strengthening our position in the region in the face of monarchical enemies.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51653;An Invitation to the Republic;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51653;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent us an offer: join the Republic of Aquitània formally, thereby uniting our resources and further ensuring the protection of our interests and our citizens. While there is some debate in our parliament about the true benefits this would have for the Maretan people - some say numerous, given the extensive trading history -, from a political standpoint, it could increase our power in the western Mediterranean, though it may worsen tensions with the countries of the Italian peninusula.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51654;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51654;The parliament of their country has agreed that the benefits of being formal members of our republic are great, and have accepted our invitation to join the republic. Surely this is the beginnings of a great, Mediterranean political system!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51655;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Proposes Autonomous Membership;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51655;Not entirely convinced of the strength and intentions of our republic, the delegates have instead made a counterproposal whereby they come under our diplomatic umbrella, but not our political one. They will still maintain their own military forces and control over the economy, but will grant us preferred status in all things and allow us to manage their foreign affairs. It isn't exactly what we were hoping for, but they may in time find that they want to join us as a full member.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51656;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses to Join;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51656;Their parliament debated for days before ultimately deciding to respectfully decline our invitation, citing their wish to fully exercise their own sovereignty. An understandable, if disappointing outcome, but our peoples and governments will continue to be friends and allies.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51657;Corsica-Sardinia Joins Aquitània;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51657;The Maretan people have risen up and established a new republic to join to Aquitània. Now it seems that we must consider our claims on the islands in that context. We could attempt to strongarm the Aquitànians into abandoning their new members, making them easy pickings for us, but it's possible they would instead stand up to our threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51658;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Corsica and Sardinia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51658;Given their interest in the region and their aggressive monarchy, we were not particularly surprised when the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador in Mauguio demanded on behalf of his country that we relinquish control of Corsica and Sardinia to their rightful owners, $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51659;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51659;Their leadership dismissed our just demand offhand, stating that they would protect the Maretan people and their own claims. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51660;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Acquiesces;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51660;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has agreed to our demands and will turn Corsica and Sardinia over to our control.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51698;Sirocco;x
EVTDESC51698;The Sirocco, the hot wind blowing from the deserts of North Africa, bathes our faces in warmth together with the sun. Today, it also brings news. It carries a call to unity and a the appeal of a common destiny with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;x
EVTNAME51699;$FROMCOUNTRY$ and the Sirocco;x
EVTDESC51699;The Sirocco, the hot wind blowing from the deserts of North Africa, bathes our faces in warmth together with the sun. Today, it also brings news. It carries the answer to our calls to unity and appeals to a common destiny from $FROMCOUNTRY$.;x
EVTNAME51700;The Eruption of Monte Pelado;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51700;The Caribbean island of Martinica was devastated today in a massive eruption of the volcano not far from the capital city of San Pedro. Of the original 30,000 inhabitants of the city, only three survivors have been found: a man imprisoned overnight for drunkenness, a little girl who managed to get to a boat ahead of the scalding miasma of death, and a shoemaker whose home on the far side of town was not destroyed. Skies across the entire region have been darkened and Martinica will take many years to recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51751;Revolt in the Holy Land;x
EVTDESC51751;The decline of Persia has become increasingly obvious in the last few decades, as the Shah's failure to implement reform has prevented the empire from catching up to its western rivals. Now, frustrated by continued repression and influenced by liberal philosophies emanating from the West, the Arabic-speaking people in the Holy Land and Mesopotamia have begun to agitate against Persian rule. Arabs are now speaking of throwing off the rule of the Shah in favor of establishing their own caliphates, and in many cases have openly attacked regional governors. Ethnic conflict and sectarian conflict in the Middle East is brewing, and it seems that the Persian Empire's days are numbered.;x
EVTNAME51752;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports Arab Rebels;x
EVTDESC51752;The collapse of our control in West has drawn the attention of European powers, who are all too eager for the chance to extend their reach into our lands. Now, $FROMCOUNTRY$ is demanding that we cede Syria and Mesopotamia to an 'impartial administration' in order to reduce ethnic tensions - a blatant attempt to assert control at our expense. What should we do?;x
EVTNAME51753;France Demands Palestine;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51753;Palestine is home to many Catholic Francophone people called 'Outremers,' a remnant of the previous Kingdom of Jerusalem which we defeated in the 16th Century. France has long sought to reunite with the Outremers, and the new instability in the Holy Land now gives them the perfect excuse. They are demanding that we cede Palestine to them as a colony in order to 'guarantee regional peace.' While giving in to the French would be enormously embarrassing, our country is weak. What choice do we really have?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51754;Persia Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51754;The Shah has agreed to our efforts to mediate the situation in the Middle East, and will allow the Arabs their own rule - under our supervision, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51755;Persia Rejects Us;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51755;The arrogant Shah cast out our nation's representative and demanded that we not interfere in Persian internal affairs. It seems the Persians will not be persuaded by words alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51756;Persia Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51756;The Shah saw reason and has agreed to let us establish our authority over Palestine. Our men are already setting up the colonial administration, marking a return to French sovereignty in the Holy Land after three centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC51757;The Shah refused to grant us the Holy Land, rudely insinuating that we are merely using the situation as an excuse to expand our colonial domain. The Outremers remain defenseless against the rioting Arabs, and many in our government are now arguing that we ought to use force to bring down the whole rotting structure of the Persian Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME51851;A Conference in Milan?;x
EVTDESC51851;In light of the violent annexation of Tuscany, the Duke of Milan has called a conference to discuss our mutual security concerns. It is clear that the Neapolitan threat will not disappear, nor will they stop at Florence. If we do not join forces, we, too, may suffer the same fate!;x
EVTNAME51895;The Premiere of La Traviata;x
EVTDESC51895;Verdi's opera premiered on March 6th, 1853, after apparently a mere 6 weeks of work. The work was an instant hit and has since become one of the most popular operas in the world. The performance at the theatre La Fenice in Venice drew massive crowds of the most important people in Venice and $COUNTRY$ as a whole.;x
EVTNAME52000;The Expansion of Westkaap;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC52000;Under the direction of colonial governor Cornelis van der Linden, the Westkaap colony has expanded north, with the ultimate goal of reaching the mighty Heeckeren River.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME52001;The Expansion of Middenkaap;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC52001;Under the direction of colonial governor Cornelis van der Linden, the Middenkaap colony has expanded north, with the ultimate goal of reaching the mighty Heeckeren River.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME52002;Xhosaland Incorporated into the Kaap Colony;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC52002;With the acquisition of the lands of the Xhosa, we can get now incorporate them into the Kaap Colony and thus expand our control over the south of the continent of Africa.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME52003;The Obbites of $PROVINCENAME$ Migrate;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC52003;The Low Saxon-speaking Obbites are Anabaptists, and have long stood even further apart from Dutch society than the other Steenkoolers. They have now decided to leave $PROVINCENAME$ for the newly-acquired Oostkaap, deciding to settle in Karbeusted, seeking the greater freedom they can find there from the Dutch.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME52004;The Obbites Leave Karbeusted;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC52004;Disgruntled with increasing Dutch control in the Oostkaap and encroachment of Dutch and Steenkooler settlers in their communities, they have decided now to leave to an area beyond our control. Their chosen area is up the coast, past the lands of the Zulu, near what is called the Delagoa Bay. Their scouts have apparently returned calling it a land of plenty, and they will call their new land Gosen.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME52005;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Proposes to Buy Natal;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC52005;Since our transfer of the Oostkaap to $FROMCOUNTRY$, Zulu tribesmen have been increasingly unruly, and there have been reports of them attacking Dutch homesteads. We have had difficulty administering these lands, and maybe it would be better to just give them away to the Germans, cutting our losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME52006;The Dutch Agree to Sell Natalia;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC52006;They have agreed to our proposed price of 15000 and will now cede the territory to us. We can now incorporate it into our South African colonies.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME52007;The Dutch Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC52007;They have turned down our offer to sell Natalia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME52200;Tribes Struck by Raiders;x
EVTDESC52200;Toro and Maures raiders have recently struck many communities in the north of the country, causing general instability. It seems we are powerless to stop them! Perhaps we can request aid from the Finnish in Ndakaaru, which they call Entakar.;x
EVTNAME52201;The Väyrynen Expedition;x
EVTDESC52201;Vapaaherra Antti Väyrynen, governor of the colony at Entakar has recently been approached by a representative from the Wolof Empire, whose ruler has requested an audience. It appears that Toro and Maures peoples have been raiding his territory recently and have caused much destruction and chaos. Väyrynen may be able to negotiate an agreement which would be beneficial for both our countries. Shall we order him to proceed?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME52202;Raided!;x
EVTDESC52202;Our lands have been attacked by raiders again! The people are suffering and it seems that the savages can't be stopped!;x
EVTNAME52203;King Killed by Raiders!;x
EVTDESC52203;A massive raid by Maures tribesmen managed to enter the capital and kill the king. Truly these are dark days!;x
EVTNAME52204;Chaos in Wolof;x
EVTDESC52204;The King of Wolof is dead and his villages burn. With Maures raiders wreaking havoc in the countryside, we should move in and ease their suffering.;x
EVTNAME52205;Chaos in Wolof;x
EVTDESC52205;Raiders continue to plague Wolof, despite our support. In order to more effectively protect his people, we need to get him to give us more control and privileges in his lands. This is for the good of the people.;x
EVTNAME52500;Pattani Rebels;x
EVTDESC52500;Despite the loss of the upper part of the peninsula in the recent war, we were able to maintain the loyalty of the local power structure in Pattani, hoping to use the province as a stepping stone to reacquiring our rightful land. However, of late, Pattani chiefs have begun to sense our weakness and inability to keep a hold on their territory and now they have outright declared independence, and have established a Sultante of their own!;x
EVTNAME53000;King Shi Jiahao;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53000;During the collapse of the Ming Dynasty in the mid-1600s, the Ming loyalist general Shi Chenggong fled to the Kingdom of Dai Nam and raised an army which successfully captured much of southern China in the period 1668 to 1682, when the Qin Empire was preoccupied with conflicts against the Mongolians, Uighurs, and Manchus. This new kingdom, which came to be called 'Nanyue' after its origins in southern Vietnam, prospered due to strong trade links with southeast Asia as well as Qin internecine troubles. In 1838, King Shi Jiahao ascended to the throne. His early reign was notable for the expansion of relations with European powers, which required leasing a treaty port on the Pearl River Delta.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53001;A Port in the Orient;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53001;We have been approached by an emmissary from the Kingdom of Nanyue in southern China with a very interesting offer: Nanyue wishes to lease us a port at the mouth of the Pearl River. This port will guarantee us preferential access to certain goods from inland China, while simultaneously helping us to develop our strategic position in the Orient. In return for the port, we will send advisors to Nanyue to teach them the ways of Christian civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53002;Charting the Course of Nanyue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53002;Recent modernisation undertaken by King Shi has exacerbated tensions between ethnic groups, as coastal Yue people have profited more quickly than inland minorities. Moreover, the increased presence of foreigners in our nation from Southeast Asia and beyond has begun to reshape the very character of Nanyue, with some elites whispering that we are no longer a Chinese state but something else entirely. These demographic and cultural changes demand a fundamental decision by the King. One option is for Nanyue to abandon our Chinese lineage and reach an accomodation with our minorities by incorporating them into the civil service, merchant and landed peasant classes. Alternatively, the Qin Empire is weaker now than ever before, and some advisors believe the time is ripe to snatch the Mandate of Heaven and emerge as the next ruling dynasty of China - albeit one with a South Asian twist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53003;Nanyue Claims the Mandate of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53003;Our southern neighbor, Nanyue, with whom we have not interfered for over a century, has repaid our generosity and kindness by stabbing us in the back! Today, King Shi claimed the Mandate of Heaven and declared Nanyue the rightful owner of all China! Already, his armies are massing at our borders, and it is clear that only a fight to the death between our nations shall resolve the question of who shall rule the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53004;The Nanyue Problem;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53004;For over a century we have treated our neighbor Nanyue with a policy of benign neglect, but today it has become apparent that this is no longer tenable. Nanyue is declaring itself a fundamentally non-Chinese state in order to circumvent internal ethnic conflict, and the window in which we can object is rapidly closing. If we do not force Nanyue to bow to our will, we will demonstrate weakness to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTNAME53005;The Qin At War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53005;Now that the Qin Empire is fighting its southern neighbor Nanyue, many of their forces have moved away from our border. We have long coveted the lands of Inner Mongolia, and now it seems we have the chance to do something about it. Perhaps it is time to remind the Chinese why they tried to build a wall to keep us out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53006;China at War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53006;Much of China is at war now, and our old enemies, the Qin, are distracted. This seems like a good opportunity to show our strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53007;Breaking Free of the Qin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53007;The Qin are beset with conflicts against multiple of their neighbors, and are more distracted than they will be again for decades, perhaps. If we want to be free of the Emperor's overlordship, now is the time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53008;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53008;Taking advantage of the conditions we are faced with in the war, our vassal $FROMCOUNTRY$ expelled its governor and demands that we recognize its independence. How do we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53009;Nanyue Stands Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53009;After much bloodshed, we have cast the Qin Emperor down from his throne and established ourselves as the rightful rulers of all China. The Mandate of Heaven truly belongs to Nanyue! Of course, there is much work to be done still. Our bureaucracy must be massively expanded, and we must contend with the barbarians to the North and West. Moreover, we have an important decision to make as we are confronted with the many provinces - and peoples - that now comprise our empire. By taking up residence in the former Imperial Palace at Zhengzhou, we can signal our alignment with the Mandarin-speaking groups that supported the Qin. Alternatively, Nanjing is not as far away but still shows commitment to northern China, and of course we could also stay in Guangzhou.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53010;The Qin Stand Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53010;The din of battle has quieted, and thousands of bodies lie rotting across the battlefields of southern China as the remaining Nanyue generals prostrate themselves before the Qin Emperor. One by one, they are made to ceremonially trample a tattered flag of Nanyue to demonstrate their allegiance. While King Shi hung himself as we entered Guangzhou, marking the end of his attempt to claim our throne, the effects of the war he started linger still. It is becoming clear that China is something more than a geographic location. Rather, it is a shared history, language system, and Confucian philosophy that unite the Chinese people. While much of China is still separated into several kingdoms, it is the destiny of the Qin to unite these disparate pieces into one Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53011;The Korea Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53011;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ envoy that they wish to hold a conference with our government, the purpose of which is to discuss the future of Korea. Given our mutual enmity, perhaps nothing will come of the talks, but $FROMCOUNTRY$ may resort to war if we do not at least attempt to compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53012;The Korea Conference Begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53012;The representatives of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have arrived, and now we must present our demands for the future of Korea. The Japanese wish to save face and retain economic interests, while our most important priority must be to secure a buffer zone between our border and $FROMCOUNTRY$. Exactly how we go about that, however, remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA53012;Korea must be fully liberated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB53012;We shall accept a demilitarized Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC53012;Perhaps we could partition Korea together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Liberation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53013;To our horror, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that the Chinese will accept nothing less than our complete and total withdrawal from Korea. Needless to say, this would be a massive blow to our international reputation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Korean Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53014;After preliminary talks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that the Chinese have no interest in Korean resources or economic leverage, but are demanding that we demilitarize Korea in order to allow for a buffer soon. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53015;Korean Partition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53015;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has asked to split Korea into exclusive interest zones, with Outer Manchuria and northern Korea belonging to China, and leaving us with the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53016;Korean Partition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53016;The Japanese have agreed to our demand that the Korean Peninsula be separated into two mutually exclusive interest zones, and our troops have moved in to quell whatever remaining resistance the Koreans may have to offer. Southern Korea now belongs to Japan, but we should still determine whether we intend to directly control northern Korea or leave a puppet government in charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53017;The Japanese Refuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53017;Unfortunately, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has rudely declined our generous offer, and now we must decide whether the Korean situation warrants further escalation. Perhaps arms can succeed where diplomats have failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53018;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53018;The conference has concluded, and $FROMCOUNTRY$ has quietly agreed to surrender control of Korea. Naturally, this allows us the opportunity for significant influence within the new Korean government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53019;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Ships in Zhengzhou;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC53019;Foreign, black ships have sailed up the Yellow River and moored themselves in front of the gates to the Imperial Palace. The foreigners claim to represent $FROMCOUNTRY$ and demand that we open the Empire up to trade with other nations. In addition, they request that we open up a legation quarter here in Zhengzhou, as well as cede a port city to them for trading purposes. A greater insult can hardly be imagined, and our ministers were speechless when the list of demands was made. Of course, the foreigners know not who they deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME53200;Loss of Control in the West;x

EVTNAME59800;Election Reforms;x
EVTDESC59800;This provisional government is taking a more permanent shape. It was recently decided in $CAPITAL$ that elections should be held, so that our government might have a more popular mandate.;x
EVTNAME59801;No More Elections;x
EVTDESC59801;The Councilmen in $CAPITAL$ have decided that the provisional government will be able to function more effectively without the needless arguing that comes naturally among elected officials. Starting today there shall be no elections until further notice.;x
EVTNAME96052;Control over Solelha?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96052;Aquitània has lost the Great War and the powers that be have decided to offer us their North American colony of Solelha. While accepting the colony could increase our burden as a large number of independent-minded people who would have a difficult time assimilating would be introduced into our society, it is a strategically valuable piece of territory which would give us the possibility of controlling one of the entrances to the Mississippi Gulf.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME96053;Control over Challans?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96053;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has lost the Great War, and now we have to decide if we wish accept control Challans, where there is a significant $COUNTRYCULTURE$ population, and which is historically part of our patrimony. Doing so would anger $FROMCOUNTRY$ and may lead to war in the future, but who are we to say no to the plight of our people calling out for unity with their homeland?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97097;Enable Story Railroading?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97097;The story in the Heirs to Aquitània mod has been crafted in such a way that some events simply must happen the way the mod's maker, Savs, intends them to. This is meant to make the sequence of events in the game more challenging (maybe), interesting, and most of all, predictable. He's included this because this mod will be the basis of his megacampaign AAR, and this is part of the story. Anyways, don't select this option if you don't want a game where the outcomes of many major events are already essentially decided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME97098;Staking our claim;;;;;;;;;x
