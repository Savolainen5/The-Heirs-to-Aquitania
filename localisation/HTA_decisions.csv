accepting_flemish_people_title;Embracing the Flemish;;;;;;;;;;x
accepting_flemish_people_desc;The Flemish of the late Duchy of Brabant are very similar to our own people linguistically and culturally. Really, we are the same people separated for too long by political borders. Let us rectify this by embracing the Flemish as our brothers!;;;;;;;;;x
aid_BYZ_ALB_title;Propose Military Aid to the Empire;;;;;;;;;x
aid_BYZ_ALB_desc;The Empire is facing a difficult time right now, and we have managed to secure autonomy. If we play our cards right, we can attain independence! By offering military aid in exchange for the promise of full sovereignty after the rebellions are over, we can offer a peaceful, respectable solution to Autokrator Georgios' problems.;;;;;;;;;;x

ANA_claim_victory_title;Claim Victory;;;;;;;;;;x
ANA_claim_victory_desc;By capturing Constantinople, the seat of the Empire and Georgios, we can end this war and claim the throne. Let Georgios flee if he likes. He who controls the city controls the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x
annexation_of_saxony_title;The Annexation of Saxony;x
annexation_of_saxony_desc;Saxony failed to take part in the Brunswick Congress, but they must not be allowed to remain outside the German question. They will join us peacefully, as much for their protection against our neighbors as for the protection of all Germans. If they do not, war is no doubt near for them.;x
annex_provence_title;Annex Prouvença;x
annex_provence_desc;Amid the background of the continued political and economic dependence of Prouvença upon our country, certain recent events have made it expedient now to formalize its incorporation into the greater Aquitànian political structure. May all of its citizens benefit from this step.;x
approach_aqt_title;Approach Aquitània;;;;;;;;;x
approach_aqt_desc;Both powers on the Italian peninsula have expressed a territorial interest in our islands. As they know we would refuse to join them, this interest is to be interpreted as a military threat to our sovereignty. Aquitània is a new-born republic like our own. We should build our relations with them, in order to secure our republic.;;;;;;;;;x 
barbarian_islands_title;Settle the Barbarian Islands;;;;;;;;;x
barbarian_islands_desc;For generations, we have exercised limited control over Hokkaido, to our north, and had even less contact with the savage natives of Takasago Koku, to our south. We should extend the beneficence of civilization to their misty shores.;;;;;;;;;x
become_albina_title;Become Albina;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_albina_desc;Now that we control all of the island of Bryten, we represent the old kingdom of Aengland hundreds of years ago. In honour of this, and our friendship with all peoples of Bryten, we will create a new empire, Albina.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
begin_greek_rebellion_title;Begin the Rebellion of Greece;;;;;;;;x
begin_greek_rebellion_desc;With crowds in Athens singing songs of the Hispanian Revolution translated into Greek Roman, Athanasius Dioskoros, Proedros of the Council of Revolutionaries, proclaimed the foundation of the Democracy of Greece to a crowd in front of the Strategeion of the Agora of Athens in 1859. Calling for all Greeks to rise up and defend the country from the incoming Roman reprisal, he laid the groundwork of Greek liberal nationalism with his 40-minute speech.;;;;;;;;;x
bohemian_zadar_title;The Zadar Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;x
bohemian_zadar_desc;Bohemia is one of the most powerful and industrialised countries in the world, yet we are landlocked and dependent on our neighbours to conduct international trade. We should change this. Having a warm relationship as we do, perhaps we could propose that Croatia lease us that port in Zadar, and we will, in return, fund railroads which both we and they can use, as well as giving them a sum of money. Our ministers expect that approximately 25,000 will be sufficient to sway them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
boukoleon_restoration_title;Restore the Boukoleon Palace;;;;;;;;;;;x
boukoleon_restoration_desc;The Boukoleon Palace was the residence of the Emperors of the Roman Empire from the 11th century until the 16th century, when it was damaged by Armenian occupations during the many wars when the Empire was on its back foot at the height of Muslim power. Since then, it has stood in ruins, as the Emperors have had other concerns. Restore and rebuild the palace to beautify and glorify our city!;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRB_sell_new_brabant_islands_title;Sell the New Brabant Islands;;;;;;;;;x
BRB_sell_new_brabant_islands_desc;Since the loss of Zeeland, we no longer have the means to maintain our far-flung colonies of New Brabant in the west Pacific. As long as we're abandoning them, we should try to make some profit off of them. Let's look for someone to buy them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRT_is_France_title;Brittany is part of France!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
BRT_is_France_desc;Brittany was a part of France not much more than a century ago. They have enjoyed their independence for long enough. Having shown them our might when we reclaimed our colony, they can't possibly refuse to rejoin us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

buy_aqt_s_ameriga_desc;Aquitània has recently informed us that they are searching for a buyer for their colony of Araguari, comprised of the two intendencies of Porterei and Nova Bordeu.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buy_dutch_natal_title;Buy Dutch Natal;;;;;;;;;;;x
buy_dutch_natal_desc;After the conclusion of the Emden Accords, the cession of Oostkaap to $COUNTRY$ isolated the former territory of the Steenkooler republic of Natal. The Dutch had difficulty administering this territory as resident Zulus began to make trouble. By offering to buy the land and incorporate it into our colonies in South Africa, we can take this problem off of their hands.;;;;;;;;;;x
call_brunswick_congress_title;Call the Brunswick Congress of Germans;;;;;;;;x
call_brunswick_congress_desc;Given the recent Bavarian violation of Mainzer sovereignty, it is clear that the king in Münich does not intend to abide by the terms of the Peace of Augsburg. Therefore, it is time to summon the old allies to a congress to propose a more permanent response to the Bavarian threat - to join forces under one banner and one ruler for the good of all!;;;;;;;;;;x
call_brunswick_congress2_title;Call the Brunswick Congress of Germans;;;;;;;;x
call_brunswick_congress2_desc;Agitation among the inhabitants of the various states of the old Holy Roman Empire has been increasing recently. Calls for German unification and a rising sense of kinship that transcends political borders has caused some unrest among the people because of the rivalries of the princes. We should call delegates from around the north to discuss the situation. External threats are another concern that will weigh heavily on delegates' minds and we will likely see many states banding together politically.;;;;;;;;;;x
cancel_zadar_lease_title;Cancel the Zadar Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cancel_zadar_lease_desc;With the fall from grace of Bohemia, they are no longer able to make use of their port. Indeed, they don't even have the means to access it at the time. Let us unilaterally end the lease and retake Zadar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
cancel_zadar_lease_HUN_title;Cancel the Zadar Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cancel_zadar_lease_HUN_desc;Our relations with Hungary have soured in recent years, and they have acted increasingly insulting towards us despite our generosity in leasing them Zadar. Let us punish their foolishness by canceling their lease unilaterally and retaking Zadar for ourselves, no matter the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;x
cede_emden_title;Cede Emden;;;;;;;;;;x
cede_emden_desc;With the failure of the diplomatic option in the proposed Emden Accords with our German neighbour, we are faced with a difficult decision. Tensions over the city will only continue to mount, and we must ask ourselves if we want to risk war to hold such a small region. If we cede the city to German and relinquish our claims, a costly war could be avoided.;;;;;;;;;x
cisalpines_are_italian_title;The Padanians are Italian!;;;;;;;;;x
cisalpines_are_italian_desc;The Cisalpine people of Padania speak a language quite similar to ours, and have long shared in the cultural and economic life of the Italian peninsula. Given our power, especially compared to theirs, surely none will dare oppose us for claiming what is rightfully ours. Gloria a la patria!;;;;;;;;x
cisalpines_are_aquitanian_title;The Padanians are Aquitanian!;x
cisalpines_are_aquitanian_desc;The Cisalpine people of Padania speak a language none too far removed from our own, and have long been part of our cultural and economic history. It is only natural that we embrace them as fellow Aquitanians, and treat them the same as our conationalists in Mauguio. Glòria a la patria!;x
claim_aegean_title;Claim the Aegean Islands;;;;;;;;;x
claim_aegean_desc;The Empire is in no position to maintain control over these islands, which have much more in common with our ideas of trade and prosperity than the dusty old notions of empire and blind loyalty to the royalty in Constantinople. We will lay claim to these islands and take them for ourselves, for the good of their inhabitants and ours;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_balearics_title;Claim the Balearic Islands;;;;;;;x
claim_balearics_desc;The Balearic Islands of Mallorca and Menorca have long held an important position in the trading of the western end of the Mediterranean, and acquiring them would bolster our reputation and ability to control and conduct trade in that region. By claiming the islands, we risk war with some powerful neighbours, but it must be done for the good of all citizens of the Republic!;;;;;;;;x
claim_bar_lorraine_title;Claim Bar and Lorraine;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_bar_lorraine_desc;The French crown's ownership of Bar and Lorraine can be traced back to the time of Charlemagne. The two duchies were part of the Holy Roman Empire, but, being on its periphery, never were an integral part, and remained neutral in the Imperial War. They are populated by French-speaking peoples, and our spies tell us there is some support for joining us. Other countries may laugh at our claim, but we will take Bar and Lorraine for ourselves! Fortitudo per unitatem!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_brittany_title;Claim Breizh;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_brittany_desc;We have long been sundered from our brothers on the European continent, proud descendants of the last holdouts from the Romans, and last holdouts of our once-numerous and great people on the continent. Now that we have reclaimed power in the north, let us extend our protection to our Breizhoneg brothers in Brittany and ensure that they will never have to face the world alone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_carapara_title;Claim the Carapara Islands;;;;;;;;;;x

claim_corsar_title;Claim Corsica and Sardinia;;;;;;;;;x
claim_corsar_desc;Corsica and Sardinia have long held an important position near the rich cities of Aquitània, Provence, and the north of the Italian Peninsula. Acquiring these islands would bolster our reputation and ability to control and conduct trade in that region. By claiming the islands, we risk war with some powerful neighbours, but it must be done for the good of all citizens of the Republic!;;;;;;;;x
claim_elsass_lothringen_title;Claim Elsass;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_elsass_lothringen_desc;There are Germans to be found in territory nominally controlled by the French. We should remedy this situation and annex this region as a buffer zone between the revanchist French and our industrial heartland.;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_empire_BAV_title;Claim the title of "Emperor of All Germany";;;;;;;;;x
claim_empire_BAV_desc;Our ascendant position among our German brethren and the increasing consolidation of our kingdom means we have the means, the will, and the right to finally prove to the world that we are the rightful rulers of Germany.

claim_galicia_title;Claim Galicia;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_galicia_desc;With our newfound power, we have the credibility and the strength to bring our northern cousins under our benevolent rule. Maybe we'll have to fight Hispania for them, but it'll be worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_heptanesa_title;Claim Heptanese Islands;;;;;;;;;x
claim_heptanesa_desc;The Heptanese islands of Zakynthus and Kerkyra have long held an important position at the mouth of the Adriatic. Acquiring these islands would bolster our reputation and ability to control and conduct trade in that region. By claiming the islands, we risk war with some powerful neighbours, but it must be done for the good of all citizens of the Republic!;;;;;;;;x
claim_malta_title;Claim Malta;;;;;;;;x
claim_malta_desc;Malta has refused our offer to join our republic. We must incorporate them, even if they are currently unwilling to see the right in our cause.;;;;;;;;;x

claim_remote_siberia_desc;We should mount an expedition to explore and formally claim the northern interior of Siberia for $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
claim_roman_throne_title;Claim the Roman Throne;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_roman_throne_desc;Evangelos Melisurgos, uncle to 15-year old Georgios, the current Autokrator of the Roman Empire through his father, Ioannes, feels that he is better suited to lead the Roman Empire in this time of rebellions and crises. By enacting this decision, you will preempt the game event which will fire approximately 9 months after Anatole has a military score of 10. You have until then to prepare for war to take the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_rose_title;Claim Rosè;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_rose_desc;Daufinat has chosen to join the Padan Union, but this is primarily because of the Cisalpine inhabitants of the Piemont. The inhabitants of the Rosè River valley and regions nearby - even in the Alps - are much closer to ours in terms of culture and language, and it would be better if they were united with their kin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_sicily_title;Claim Sicily;;;;;;;;;x
claim_sicily_desc;Sicily has long held an important position separating the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean, and has changed hands many times throughout the centuries. Acquiring this populous island would bolster our reputation and ability to control and conduct trade in the central Mediterranean. By claiming Sicily, we risk war with some powerful neighbours, but it must be done for the good of all citizens of the Republic!;;;;;;;;x
claim_suazi_title;Claim the Lands of the Suazi;;;;;;;;;x
claim_suazi_desc;Our impi are strong and our kingdom feared by all. Let us take what will not be willingly given to us, starting with the tiny kingdom of the Suazi!;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_venice_PDN_title;Assert Our Claim to Venice;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_venice_PDN_desc;A foreign conqueror stole Venice from the Cisalpine people while our federation was taking its first breaths, a time when we were unable to contest the conqueror. Now that we are strong and established, the Doge-of-Venice-in-Exile is petitioning us to assert his (and thereby our) claim to Venice, and restore order to the region.;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_wales_cornwall_title;Claim Cymru and Kerno;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_wales_cornwall_desc;As we grow in strength, we may challenge Aengland for control over our Celtic brothers in Cymru and Kerno. We will, of course, have to fight a long and hard war if we want to actually hold these territories, but we can face that when the time comes.;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_zeeland_title;Claim Zeeland;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_zeeland_desc;Being a great and powerful nation, others will surely not deny that we are the rightful owners of Zeeland. Indeed, some of the towns and cities of the region expressed interest in joining our kingdom when we united in 1814. However, they already belonged to the Duchy of Brabant, and the Duke there was not friendly to the cause we represented. Now, however, we can take Zeeland by force, if we must.;;;;;;;;;;;x
colonise_drytsiben_title;Colonise Drytsiben;;;;;;;;;x
colonise_drytsiben_desc;We should expand out to the edge of our claims on the plains so that no one else can take them from us. These lands may be fertile farmlands, or perhaps some useful resources might be found in them. Besides, more land for our growing population is always good.;;;;;;;;;x
colonise_jukuna_title;Colonise Jukuna;;;;;;;;x
colonise_jukuna_desc;The lands that the natives call Jukuna are, quite frankly, inhospitable. But with the gold and other riches we found in Iggatlan, there may be more further north! Besides, some opportunistic states, like Dabimon or Hispania, may in time try to lay claim to the north, and thus try to envelop us in some way. Let us instead settle some key outposts and ensure that these lands are made ours!;;;;;;;;;;x
colonise_necen_title;Colonise Necen;x
colonise_necen_desc;The interior of Ameriga just east of the great mountains is good farming land, and sparsely inhabited by natives. Let us claim it for $COUNTRY$!;x
colonise_newea_title;Colonise Newea;x
colonise_newea_desc;The vast plains of the center of Ameriga stretch far north, and the region we have come to call Newea is the northern limit of good farmlands. If we take it, we can secure our frontier and acquire fertile land for the good of $COUNTRY$.;x
colonise_oai_title;Colonise Oailand;;;;;;;;;;x
colonise_oai_desc;There yet remain unclaimed areas of the inner plains of Ameriga, inhabited by a few savages clinging to their ways. If these lands are anything like the neighbouring provinces we own, they could be fertile farm- and grazelands. Let us claim the territory for our own, before someone else takes it!;;;;;;;;;;x
colonise_rouge_ues_title;Colonise Rouge-Ues;;;;;;;;;x
colonise_rouge_ues_desc;It is time to expand into the interior of the northern plains. These are vast, treeless expanses, but explorers have long claimed that they would be fertile farmland and grazeland. It will cost some money to fund settlements in key locations to establish our claims, but rest assured, it'll be worth it.;;;;;;;;;x
colonise_ters_dauror_title;Colonise the Interior of the Ters d'Auror;;;;;;;;;x
colonise_ters_dauror_desc;These lands in the far north of the continent are not good for much, being filled with stunted forests and permafrost, but if we don't claim them, someone else might, like Skamisc or another greedy country. Who knows, maybe one day some use may come of these lands.;;;;;;;;;;x
declaration_of_mantua_ai_title;Promulgate the Declaration of Mantua;;;;;;;;;;;;x
declaration_of_mantua_ai_desc;In 1849, the Council of the Union, at the behest of its constituent rulers and in light of the growing strength and cohesion of the Union's armed forces, made a joint proclamation to the world. Considered to be the seeds of a national identity, the Declaration decreed that all states which the Neapolitan kingdom had absorbed must be released by Neapolitan King Giuseppe I Salenino. It further stated the ambition of the Padan Union to annex the Romagna region into its territory, given its proximity to the namesake Po River. By issuing this declaration, war between Naples and the Union was a foregone conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;x

declare_romanian_unity_title;Declare the Unity of the Volasean Peoples;;;;;;;;;;x
declare_romanian_unity_desc;With the instability and troubles in the Empire, the growing nationalist unrest in the Volasean provinces could finally be funelled into a successful movement. Under the guidance of Hospodar Gradisteanu, the boyars and obste are mobilising to help Romania forge its own path. This will mean war with the Empire and our brothers in Wallachia, who lick the heels of the Romans.;;;;;;;;;;x

demand_independence_BYZ_title;Demand Independence from the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;x
demand_independence_BYZ_desc;Now that the war is over and Georgios has defeated his uncle, the Empire is restabilized. At the beginning of the war, we offered our military support in exchange for independence after peace had been restored. Let us now remind Georgios and his counselors of his promise so that we may stand on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dissolve_old_duchy_CMP_title;Dissolve the old Duchy of Champagne;;;;;;;;;x
dissolve_old_duchy_CMP_desc;Now that we have claimed the throne of France, the Duchy of Champagne should pass from a legitimate title of power to one merely of respect.

dominate_the_kazakhs_title;Dominate the Kazakhs;x
dominate_the_kazakhs_desc;The Kazakh Khanate is one of many petty states of the steppe, and in times gone by, their people raided $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands and posed us a significant threat. But times have changed and as we start to look past the old Russia-Smolensk division, we must turn our eyes to the southeast, where there is opportunity to be had. Let us begin by establishing influence over the Kazakhs, that we may use them for further expansion in the future.;x
embrace_catalans_title;Embrace Catalans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_catalans_desc;The Catalans have always been a proud people, often discontented with living under the Hispanian Empire. Nevertheless, with time and effort it will be possible to bring them back into the fold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_catalans_IRK_title;Embrace Catalans;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_catalans_IRK_desc;The Catalans of the Balearic Islands Mallorca and Menorca have long been an important part of trading in the western part of the Mediterranean. We should make them feel welcome in our republic and give them equal rights.;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_galicians_title;Embrace Galicians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_galicians_desc;The Galician people have a unique cultural identity, though one it is not entirely different from that of the Spanish. We should work to make them feel welcome within our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_irish_title;Embrace the Éirisc;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_irish_desc;With control over Éirland now established, we should look toward integrating them into our own culture, allowing them some say in our government and welcome among our own people.;;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_maretans_title;Embrace the Maretans;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_maretans_desc;The Marenan people are few and confined to their islands, but they are a proud race with a long history of self-reliance and self-sufficience.

embrace_nanfaren_desc;The Southerners speak languages that sound different than ours, and they prefer rice over noodles, but we are all Chinese.;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_portuguese_title;Embrace Portuguese;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_portuguese_desc;The Portuguese speak a language that is noticeably distinct from Spanish and will resent our rule at first. However, by allowing some regional autonomy and making a sincere effort to respect their culture, we might forge a new era of cooperation between the Spanish and Portuguese people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_romansh_title;Protect Romansh People;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_romansh_desc;The Romansh people are a small minority we inherited after annexing Helvetia. Too few to have their own country, members of local Romansh communities have petitioned our government for official protection, as was the case under the Helvetian government. They cite their strong ethnic and cultural ties to Germany - despite their strange language -, as well as their past services to Helvetia, which they would gladly pass to us as their new rulers should we allow them the same rights as proper Germans. Offering protection to such a petty minority might demean a country as great as ours, but would be looked up favorably in the eyes of foreign moralists, as well as helping to restore a sense of normalcy to the former Helvetian cantons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_sicilians_title;Embrace the Sicilians;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_sicilians_desc;The Sicilian people are hardworking and numerous. They have elected now to seek prosperity in partnership with us. They should have ever right and privilege extended to them as to our Greek-speaking citizens, for the good of all.;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_slovaks_title;Embrace the Slovaks;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_slovaks_desc;The Slovaks have long lived peacefully under our rule. Almost identical in language and culture, their separate identity stems more from geography than anything else. By calling them equals and allowing them use of their language in Slovakia proper, we will earn their adoration and simultaneously make governance easier.;;;;;;;;;;x
emden_accords_title;Propose a Solution to Emden;;;;;;;;;;x
emden_accords_desc;With the further unifications of the Germans of the north, they now have real cause and real strength to reclaim Emden, which we refused to give to Brunswick.

enlist_tatars_title;The Kazan Pact - Kazanskii Dogovor;;;;;;;;;;;;x
enlist_tatars_desc;The more populous crown of Smolensk, which falsely claims to be heir to Russia, has many more soldiers than do we. There is, however, opportunity. The Tatars, the once-feared horselords of the steppe, are divided subjects of both countries. If we curry favour with them, we may be able to destabilize Smolensk, allowing us to defeat them. By accepting the Kazani Tatars as equals, we may gain an important advantage with all of the inhabitants of the steppe. However, stories of their cruelty remain and the other peoples of our empire may not be so happy.;;;;;;;;;;x
expand_BHN_title;Claim Hungary's Historical Borders;;;;;;;;;x
expand_BHN_desc;The crown of Hungary once encompassed a much wider area than it does today. We can expand our territory and further earn the loyalty of the Hungarians by helping them reclaim their historical greatness.;;;;;;;;;;x
expand_halesca_title;Expand Halesca;;;;;;;;;;x
expand_halesca_desc;Given Skamisc and other countries' ambitions in North Ameriga, it seems prudent to claim the land all the way to the Skamisc border at the 141st parallel. That way, none can try to sneak around us, and we can exploit the resources to be found in our rich, if far-flung, colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
expand_to_kilikia_title;Expand to Kilikia;;;;;;;;;;x
expand_to_kilikia_desc;With the war over and peace restored, we can once again look outward. The Muslims in Armenia are weak and hold territory that was once Roman. Let us reclaim it and cut them off from the Mediterranean, thus weakening them further.;;;;;;;;x

expedition_to_okhotsk_desc;In 1845, Count Bogdan Svetayev was commissioned by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to explore and lay claim to lands at the western coast of Asia beyond the recently conquered lands of the Yakuts.

form_irakleio_desc;The fortunes of our island trade republic continue to rise, and it is necessary that we no longer be confined to an old name and an old way of thinking. We must restructure our country to better ensure our continued survival and prosperity. Let us rebrand ourselves as the Republic of Irakleio, a truly cosmopolitan country where prosperity, not ethnicity or language, is the deciding factor in a man's worth.;;;;;;;;x

form_zachadia_title;Form Zachadia;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_zachadia_desc;Some philologists have confirmed what we have already long known: that the Poles, Czechs, Silesians, Slovaks, and Sorbs all speak closely related languages. These languages they have come to call the Western Slavic family. Given our cultural, linguistic, and geographical proximity, we could unite our peoples into a truly great nation.'\n\n\ $Y NB: Western Slavs must control Silesian and Polish cores (Slovakia can be owned by them, or Hungary can be puppeted), and Prague/Bohemia must be sphered and puppeted with +100 relations.;;;;;;;;;;x
FRA_embrace_bretons_title;Integrate the Bretons;x
FRA_embrace_bretons_desc;The Bretons will continue to be troublesome and agitate for independence unless something is done to appease them. By granting them the same rights that proper French citizens have, perhaps we may succeed in appeasing them and reducing their unruliness and restlessness.;x
FRA_embrace_picards_title;Embrace the Picards;x
FRA_embrace_picards_desc;While they may speak a strange variant of our own language, we must look to the Picards as cousins, at least. Let us show them that they will do just as well under the French umbrella as under the Wallonian one, even if it leaves a bad taste in our mouth to make such a concession to them.;x
FRA_embrace_walloons_title;Walloon Societal Integration;x
FRA_embrace_walloons_desc;The Walloons will be restive for generations unless we grant them some place in our society. We will grant them concessions if only so that their rich lands will be more productive for us than they currently are.;x
FRA_levant_ultimatum_title;The Outremer Question;x
FRA_levant_ultimatum_desc;The Outremer people of the Levant, descendents of French crusaders from the Middle Ages, have long languished under the Persian yoke. With a now-unified and strong France, and unrest in the Levant rising to a fever pitch, it is our moral imperative to unite with our long-sundered brethren. Repeated intransigence by the Shah's government leaves us no choice - they must accept our ultimatum or face our wrath.;x

further_the_revolution_in_DAU_desc;The monarchists of our cousins in Daufinat are facing serious opposition from their own liberal people, who seek to set up a democracy similar to the one we have been so successful in establishing. By sending a military mission, we may be able to convince the Duke, Guigues de Mauguio, to give up rather than lose his life fighting for a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;x
garda_civica_title;Form the Garda Civica;;;;;;;;;;x
garda_civica_desc;In revolutionary Aquitània, giving the people more say in the maintenance of order was a top priority in securing and legitimising the new, post-royal government.

greek_macedonia_arbenon_desc;Now that we have proven our strength to the failing Empire and to the world, it is time to expand our democracy to the north, to the ancient Greek lands before the Empire established its rule over us all those long centuries ago. The myriad peoples in these lands have much in common historically and culturally with ours, even if their languages may now be different. Let us incorporate them into our revolutionary democracy!;;;;;;;;x

helvetian_patrimony_desc;The Germans of the South are united under one flag. Almost united. The cantons of Helvetia, long isolated by choice from Germany proper, must be brought into the fold. It will not be by their decision that the destiny of Germany left to rot by the side of the road to glory. They must join us, for the good of all Germans.;;;;;;;;;;x
hispania_by_sword_title;Begin the Reconquista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hispania_by_sword_desc;Hispania was always one of the dominant powers in western Europe, but in 1829, the League of the Ten Monarchs violently and unjustly stripped away many of our core lands to limit our power even as they restored us to our rightful place on the throne. By declaring a Reconquista of all Iberia, we will announce our objective to take back what was once ours. Hispania will rise again, and may the consequences damn whoever stands in our way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HtA_POL_setup_title;Poland Setup;x
HtA_POL_setup_desc;Poland is ruled not only by the king, but also by the Sejm - a legislative chamber composed of nobles of the realm who vote by majority rule. This body has met semi-annually for six weeks since time immemorial. A democratic body, it stands in stark opposition to the more absolutist methods of rule Poland's neighbours employ. The involvement of nobility tends to guarantee their investment in the well-being of the state, and this has effects beyond the legislation the body produces: each member ensures that the land he owns is as prosperous as can be.;x
incite_byelorussians_title;Incite Byelorussians;;;;;;;;;;;x
incite_byelorussians_desc;If we are to continue to weaken our rival in Smolensk, then it will not be on the field of battle, but in the hearts and minds of the downtrodden minorities of their empire. We will stir up local grievances in order to sow chaos in their country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
incite_ukrainians_title;Incite Ukrainians;x
incite_ukrainians_desc;The Ukrainians have long had a separate identity from the Great Russians, even those of Smolensk. Their culture and language are similar, but their history of fraternization with the Cossacks has institutionalized distrust against them by the ruling elites of the country. We can inflame old tensions to strengthen the Ukrainians and to cause further headaches for Smolensk.;x
incorporate_brabant_title;Incorporate Brabant into the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;x
incorporate_brabant_desc;Now that we've claimed Zeeland, why not just get the rest of the Duchy of Brabant, too? After all, its inhabitants are all Dutch speakers, even if they have a strange dialect. Incorporating the Flemish of Brabant is a natural step in continuing to ensure our greatness.;;;;;;;;;;x
info_POL_title;HtA Poland Info;x
info_POL_desc;There is still work to be done on Poland with regard to the Sejm. Don't sphere Smolensk because you'll mess up the story that's going on there. You'll get a chance to reclaim some land from them before they go to war with Russia.;x
info_RUS_title;HtA Russia Info;x
info_RUS_desc;War with Smolensk will come later, it's designed that you can't fabricate on them right away. Focus on building up your military and getting through the decision chains to sow discontent in their territory and get allies. Go as far east as possible with colonization. Only after you've taken the decision to incite Ukrainians will the CB to fight the Russian Hegemony war become available for both countries (or if it's after 1850). As long as you win one war with that CB (take whatever state you want), you will cause an event chain which will cause Smolensk to disintegrate and be annexed to you. After you get Nationalism and Imperialism, you can consider sphereing the four central Asian countries and then wait for an event to fire which will annex them, or you could just go to war.;x
info_SML_title;HtA Smolensk Info;x
info_SML_desc;You start in a very strong position to overwhelm Russia (indeed, it should be easy!), but you'll have to be patient. You'll be able to fabricate the special casus belli later after certain conditions are met - namely the Russians have to have taken a decision to incite your Ukrainian POPs (or if it's after 1850). The reason for not being able attack right away is that the populace of Smolensk, being highly faithful, would never (initially) support a war against Russia. To be honest, I don't expect a lot of people to play Smolensk because it's likely to be a boring first two or three decades. After you get Nationalism and Imperialism, you can consider sphereing the four central Asian countries and then wait for an event to fire which will annex them, or you could just go to war.;x
inland_claims_title;Our Inland Claims;;;;;;;;;;;x
inland_claims_desc;Uilscyr has been making plans to go up and claim the far reaches of the tributaries of the Jordrac River. This would bring them uncomfortably close to our territory. We should beat them to the punch, and maybe we'll discover some useful and interesting things in these lands.;;;;;;;;;;x
integrate_cymru_title;Integrate Cymru;;;;;;;;x
integrate_cymru_desc;It was only in 1829 that the Duke of Cymru, Owain of Aberdaugleddau, made his realm subservient to ours, in a moment of diplomatic clarity. However, recent events between our two countries and a changing diplomatic situation abroad necessitate that we establish direct control over the Cymraeg lands. Perhaps the Duke can be made to see reason, but if not, then use of force must be considered.;;;;;;;;;;x
integrate_navarra_title;Integrate Navarra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
integrate_navarra_desc;Personal unions and vassal states are an antiquated concept more befitting of the 17th century than the 19th. Let us work to make Navarra a truly intrinsic part of the Hispanian Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

integrate_wallonia_desc;The Walloons are our brothers, even if they speak a strange language. We share a common history and a common fate. There can be no arguing that greater control would be beneficial for all involved! However, other nations will not necessarily look kindly upon this move and may even declare war in an attempt to preserve the local power balance.;x

look_for_a_buyer_for_aqt_s_a_desc;In light of the recent banning of slavery in Aquitània, the value of our plantations in our South Amerigan colony of Araguari has crashed. We should consider selling the land - the intendencies of Nova Bordeu and Porterei to Gidan or Uilscyr. The latter, in particular, would probably be interested in the territory, given its proximity to their capital at the mouth of the Jordrac River.;;;;;;;;x

norwegian_caribbean_title;Issue the Declaration of Kajahikos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norwegian_caribbean_desc;For a great many years the king in Anslo had been forced to accept the sovereignty of various elected legislative bodies due to the strictures of the Constitution of 1822, which was ultimately accepted by the royal family under duress. However, the alignment of many of those legislative bodies with the destabilizing forces of Albesanism and the subsequent royal coup, which saw members of the royal family and the solidly absolutist army and navy dissolve the liberal constitution, have rendered the king a free hand in Norway. With support for the royals and Nordic nationalism both at an all-time high, and the Norwegian Navy quite large and abundantly capable of projecting force in the region, Olav Erling, the Duke of Faroe, has traveled to the Norwegian-held island of Kajahikos and, acting on orders from his elder brother King Håkon IV, proclaimed the intent of the Norwegian Crown to annex the islands of Firgene, Heymak, Curasu, and Welighefen by right of conquest. We will forge a great Atlantic empire just as the Vikings before us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

partition_daufinat_desc;Daufinat has been a threat to Aquitània for centuries. There was indeed a time not much more than one century ago when they were more powerful than us. Times are different now, and with the new Duke having inherited Aymon de Buonavi's throne being a less than competent leader, we have an opportunity to expand our holdings to the Alps and improve relations with the Padan Union. We can negotiate a deal to partition Daufinat among ourselves, which will improve the strategic and international standing of both of our countries! \n§RNote: Immediate war is possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PDN_create_title;Create the Padan Union;;;;;;;;;;;;x

PER_abadan_treaty_port_desc;The Port of Abadan is located on the salty delta at the terminus of the great Mesopotamian rivers.

PER_bandar_abbas_treaty_port_title;The Port of Bandar Abbas;x
PER_bandar_abbas_treaty_port_desc;The Port of Bandar Abbas occupies a strategic position controlling the Strait of Hormuz. Controlling it would give us an ideal position to control trade between the Near East and India as well as projecting power in the region.;x
PER_bushire_treaty_port_title;The Port of Bushire;x
PER_bushire_treaty_port_desc;The port of Bushire has had a key role in maritime trade for Iranian polities since antiquity. Taking it would give us a commercial foothold in the region, as well as giving us leverage over the rump Persia.;x
PER_chabahar_treaty_port_title;The Port of Chabahar;x
PER_chabahar_treaty_port_desc;The Port of Chabahar has historically been a major trade node in the trade between India and the West. Taking it would give us a port on the Indian Ocean and allow us to project power on the mouth of the Indus and beyond.;x
PER_levant_victory_title;Victory in the Levant;x
PER_levant_victory_desc;The Persian armies have braved great trials in our war against the warmongering westerners who came seeking to carve our Levantine possessions up for themselves, achieving a victory that many even in Persia did not consider to be possible. Triumph, however, has come at a great cost, and now we must ensure that the Outremer people, who were the source of these troubles, be dealt with in such a way that our hold on the Levant will never again be threatened. We shall exile them to the mountainous interior of our country.;x

Let us bring our brothers closer so that we may share with them our knowledge and our strength, protecting them from the white man.;;;;;;;;x

reclaim_catalonia_title;Reclaim Catalonia;;;;;;;;;;x
reclaim_catalonia_desc;It has been decades since Catalonia was stripped from us in the aftermath of the Liberal Rebellion.

reduce_infamy_desc;So you're playing HtA, and suddenly you come across a buggy situation where you've got more than 25 infamy, eh? It WAS a bug and not your crazy world-conquering ambitions, right? If it's "Yes, Savs, it's your fault," take this and tell me what happened on the forums so I can fix it. You would never abuse this, right?;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_albina_title;Reform Albina;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_albina_desc;Although we have lost the title before, we can once again claim it. With the island of Bryten once more united under our rule, we should take up the mantle of Albina for the good of all its inhabitants!;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_qin_empire_title;Reform the Qin Empire;;;;;;;;;x
reform_qin_empire_desc;Liberal ideas have penetrated China and threaten to disturb the sanctity of the Empire. By drafting a constitution, we can guarantee our position in power while acknowledging the rights of the Chinese people. Qin Diguo, Wan Sui!;;;;;;;;;x
renovate_constantinople_title;Renovate Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;;x
renovate_constantinople_desc;Constantinople has stood relatively unchanged for centuries, and is a hodgepodge of different building styles and qualities. The city is constantly growing, and there have been housing and social problems. By renovating the city and building taller buildings, we can truly make Constantinople the City of World's Desire once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
request_return_of_lubeck_title;Request the Return of Lübeck;;;;;;;;;;x
request_return_of_lubeck_desc;The Danes have held the port city of Lübeck for centuries and insisted on their right to the surrounding area.

restore_order_in_hungary_title;Restore Order in Hungary;;;;;;;;;;x
restore_order_in_hungary_desc;With the rising tide of unrest and chaos in Hungary, it is time for the to monarchy make a strong response to the situation in its southern component. Let us restore order in Hungary before a full-blown rebellion breaks loose!;;;;;;;;;;x

retreat_to_hayastan_desc;With the loss of our lands in Asia Minor and particularly the capital of Yerzinka, it is time to fall back to the mountains of old Hayastan and dig in against any further Roman attacks. We have lost Asia Minor, but surely we will regain it some day!;x
return_croatian_land_title;Seek the Return of Croatian Land;;;;;;;;;;;x
return_croatian_land_desc;Per our agreement with Croatia, we should see if we can convince Austria to hand over Old Croatia peacefully, using our relationship with them. Alternatively, we could simply coerce them with strength of arms. In any case, after returning Zagreb and its surroundings to Croatia, we can finally acquire our port. Austria will probably ask for compensation.;;;;;;;;;;x
return_croatia_to_croatia_title;Return Croatia its Land;;;;;;;;;;;x
return_croatia_to_croatia_desc;Having acquired the historical region of Old Croatia, we can now return it to the Duchy. Once we turn it over to them, they should inform us shortly that the deal to lease Zadar is finalised.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

revolt_against_smolensk_title;Revolt Against Smolensk;;;;;;;;;x
revolt_against_smolensk_desc;The Russians have promised us freedom and protection from Smolensk if we aid them in the war. Indeed, they have been spreading unreast among all the Tatars and steppe peoples, even outside our land. With the Russians, we will have greater freedom. To war!;;;;;;;;;x
roman_adriatic_title;Roman Adriatic;;;;;;;;;;x
roman_adriatic_desc;Now that we have reclaimed Italy, we should once more look to the Adriatic Sea. Claiming the land around the coast will be costly diplomatically, but none will prevent the Roman Eagle from spreading its wings again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

scaglia_decree_title;The Scaglia Decree;;;;;;;;;;x
scaglia_decree_desc;From the newly appointed summer residence at Scaglia near Civitavecchia, King Giuseppe II Salenino decreed that all denizens of Tuscany and Romagna were to become Italian citizens effective immediately, with all the rights pertaining. This was devastating to the nascent rebel movements in the regions. Their hitherto popular support was all but eliminated in an instant as the weary people of the north began to give up fighting for a lost cause and accepted their place as equals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
secure_silesia_title;Secure Silesia from Foreign Encroachment;;;;;;;;;x
secure_silesia_desc;With its vast reserves of coal and other materials vital for fueling a country's industry, Silesia is of great interest to a number of its neighbours. Given the influence $COUNTRY$ exerts in their politics, we could arrange for a "change in leadership" that would ensure the Duchy remains loyal to $COUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$ alone.;;;;;;;;;;x
secure_silesia_2_title;Political Integration of Silesia;;;;;;;;;;;x
secure_silesia_2_desc;It has been some time since the country of Silesia "assented" to our hegemony, but they have remained autonomous for all that time. Ours is a prosperous nation, and it would be mutually beneficial for both $COUNTRY$ and Silesia for the latter to be joined. We will now proceed to integrate Silesia into our political structure, and we may all prosper!;;;;;;;;;x
sell_alaska_title;Sell Halesca;;;;;;;;;;x
sell_alaska_desc;With the loss of our colonies in the Amerigas and our current financial situation, it has become quite burdensome to maintain our colony of Halesca. In order to reach it, we have to travel extremely far, either around the Southern Cape of South Ameriga, or by shipping all the way to the East Indies. No, there are others there that may be convinced to buy it and rid us of this burden.;;;;;;;;;;;x
sell_dutch_natal_title;Sell the Natal;;;;;;;;;;x
sell_dutch_natal_desc;Now that we have given the Oostkaap to the Germans, our colony in Natal, former Steenkooler and Zulu territory, is now somewhat isolated from the rest of the Kaap. Perhaps we should also give it to the Germans in exchange for a sum.;;;;;;;;;;;x
sell_solelha_title;Sell Solelha;;;;;;;;;;x
sell_solelha_desc;With the abolishment of slavery, the colony of Solelha has seen profits collapse as former slaves abandon the hitherto profitable plantations. The colony has become a burden. Perhaps Margaria would be interested?;;;;;;;;;x

settle_namaqualand_desc;Recent surveys in the region indicate that the Namaqualand region north of the Heeckeren River has some interesting resources, and already some of our people from the Kaap Colony have expressed interest in farming the region.

siak_protectorate_title;The Siak Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;x
siak_protectorate_desc;With the Sultanate of Atjeh recently being annexed, we now have formal competition on the island of Sumatra for resources and favour. Let's use our contacts in the Sultanate of Siak to bring them closer to us, so as to limit the spread of our rivals on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;x

stilhav_naval_base_title;Construct the Stilhav Naval Base;;;;;;;;;;x
stilhav_naval_base_desc;It wasn't until the mid-1830s that the government of Høyekysten had the resources to begin asserting control over the Pacific coast. Military engineers scouted the location for the naval base in 1833, but it wasn't until 1836 that the plan was approved and construction began. Although a costly project, the base afforded the country control over the Pacific coast and was essential in action against the Andean peoples to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
subjugate_yakuts_title;Subjugate the Yakuts;;;;;;;;;;x
subjugate_yakuts_desc;In 1840, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers led by Count Aleksei Boroditzki, stationed in Irkutsk, began a campaign of terror and repression against the Yakuts at the frontier of $COUNTRY$ as part of a royal edict to push through the sparsely populated Siberian wilderness to the Pacific coast.

subjugate_yakuts_finish_desc;With their warriors scattered and their greatest settlements under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control, Count Boroditzki offered his liege news of victory over the Yakuts, securing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ dominance over the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
support_bohemian_partisans_title;Support Partisans in Bohemia;;;;;;;;;x
support_bohemian_partisans_desc;We are clearly too weak now to take back our land by outright force, so we must resort to subterfuge. Let us fund some partians in our former territory and try to convince the new owners that the land isn't worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;x
support_latvian_rebels_title;Support Latvian Rebels;;;;;;;;;;;x
support_latvian_rebels_desc;We have heard the plight of the Latvians. Long have they struggled and suffered under Finnish rule, and now they have decided to take action. We can support them against the Finns and thereby earn a stalwart ally and weaken their masters in one stroke.;;;;;;;;;;;x
suppress_tuscan_resistance_title;Suppress Tuscan Resistance;;;;;;;;;x
suppress_tuscan_resistance_desc;With our recent conquest of the Duchy of Tuscany, many remain in its former lands who actively seek justice for the collateral damage our troops caused during the war.

treaty_of_brest_title;The Treaty of Brest;;;;;;;;;x
treaty_of_brest_desc;Ever since our defeat in the Byelorussian War in 1748, we have been waiting for an opportunity to reclaim Brest-Litovsk from Smolensk. At long last, we have our opportunity. They are at war with the Russians, and the border is not well-guarded. If we strike quickly, possibly in coordination with the Russians, we may be able to right the wrong done to us a century ago. But that is merely the threat. Let us first see whether Smolensk will return our land peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;x
treaty_of_twist_title;The Treaty of Twist;;;;;;;;;x
treaty_of_twist_desc;With the conclusion of the Brunswick Congress, we are now have the very real possibility to unite the Germans under our banner. The matter of Emden, which the Netherlands seized from Oldenburg in 1827, should be settled, as it will create unnecessary friction between our two countries now that we have inherited Oldenburg's claim. We can propose the town of Twist, on the border, to be a meeting ground for negotiations over the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;x

unite_crowns_BHN_title;Unite the Crowns of Bohemia and Hungary;;;;;;;;;x
unite_crowns_BHN_desc;In the aftermath of the Hungarian Revolution, the question of the place of Hungary in Bohemia became widely discussed.

window_to_the_west_LAT_title;Window to the West - Latvia;;;;;;;;;;x
window_to_the_west_LAT_desc;Our great country lies so close to the Baltic Sea, yet has no access. Securing a port would allow us to enrich our lands and project our power better against rivals on our western frontier. The newly-independent Latvia is a perfect possibility. Their economy is small and they need aid in modernising. With just a small cash infusion, we could gain important influence that could be used to establish our control over the country, and, most importantly, its coastline.;;;;;;;;;;;x
window_to_the_west_LIT_title;Window to the West - Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;x
window_to_the_west_LIT_desc;Our great country lies so close to the Baltic Sea, yet has no access. Securing a port would allow us to enrich our lands and project our power better against rivals on our western frontier. Lithuania, a state long on the fringes of Europe, has somehow avoided much attention from Poland and Finland. Their economy is small and they need aid in modernising. With just a small cash infusion, we could gain important influence that could then be used to establish formal control over the country and, most importantly, its coastline.;;;;;;;;;;x
yoke_the_tatars_title;Yoke the Tatars;x
yoke_the_tatars_desc;While they were a useful ally during the war to unify Great Russia, it is no longer necessary to allow them the autonomy they demand. They are simply no longer necessary as allies, and so it is time to force them to settle for good. Just as the Tatars once shackled us, we shall now shackle them and integrate them into our new empire. They will not go quietly, but they will go.;x
