EVTNAME10000;Springtime of Nations;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10000;After less than a decade of quiet following the Hispanian Revolution and its subsequent defeat, it was clear to all of Europe that the dark clouds of liberalism creeping across Europe were not harmless. The clouds broke into an angry storm as liberal agitation erupted into open revolution across the continent. The Monarchical Ancien Regimes of Europe could only look on in horror and disgust, as the hymns of the Hispanian Revolution could again be heard echoing from Europe's tumultuous streets, and students and youth again gathered under republican quartereds, celebrating the ideals, dreams and wishes of a young generation, animated by the powerful message of human liberty -- in economic, cultural, social and national affairs -- that was European Liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10000;We will be freemen, as our fathers were.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME10001;An Age of Liberalism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10001;Although political liberalism was defeated not much more than a decade ago in the Hispanian War (1826-1829), its ideas and its lessons could not be purged from the memory of Europeans. Throughout Europe, as old legal systems find themselves increasingly challenged by modern technology and mores, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon. As the dust settles on the battlefields of Catalonia and Navarra, Europe stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10001;We can expect increased liberal activity in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10050;Broken, busted, and thrown to the sides lie the barricades, and the cantoned flags have stopped waving from the window sills. The events that will be recorded by history as the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Liberal Revolution of $YEAR$ are all in the past, and it seems that we have managed to weather the storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME10180;Anti-Albesan Tract;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC10180;In a time when the forces of revolution threaten to overthrow all the long-established orders of Europe, it becomes our sacred duty to voice our dissent. The Albesans -- holding nothing sacred save the profane -- are charlatans peddling false ideologies. What the liberal terror brought to Hispania, their radicalism now threatens to impose on $COUNTRY$.'\n\nThe widespread liberal agitation in $COUNTRY$ has mobilized the forces of reaction, and a leading conservative intellectual has published an Anti-Albesan tract.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME10210;Albesan Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC10220;The sound of rain falling on the deserted square is deafening. A tattered pamphlet, thrown in the gutter -- the ink running out across the paper in soft blueish blooms -- is the only thing that still serves as proof that $PROVINCENAME$ was, up until just recently, a hotbed of liberal agitation. Depicted on the pamphlet is Lady Liberty, the iconographic personification of the Hispanian revolution, holding a republican cantoned flag. The pamphlet reads: 'Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood -- $COUNTRY$'. It is soon swept away by the rain and down into the sewers whence it came.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME10231;The Great Hungarian Uprising;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10231;Hungarian nationalists have become increasingly vocal in recent months at the unjust rulership that our supposedly democratic country has over them without their consent or participation. They have recently taken up arms and assaulted government officials and attacked our offices. If we are to call ourselves a democratic country, better than the absolute monarchy which we had until recently, then we must recognise our own failings and accommodate these people.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME11104;Revolution in $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11104;A pro-$UNION_ADJ$ revolution has taken hold in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Its liberal leaders believe that $COUNTRY$ is the nation best-suited to unite all of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, and thus have sworn to support us until the union is ready to occur.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME11106;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11106;$MONARCHTITLE$, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador has presented us with news from the recent parliament of German revolutionaries. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to assemble a federation of German states, with the goal of eventually forming a greater Germany. If we do not agree,it is possible that $FROMCOUNTRY$ will attempt to take our lands by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME11108;Slavic Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11108;The call has gone out for the Slavic nations of the Balkans to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Austrians and Turks as well as other European powers. Yugoslavia, it is said, will be a power to rival even its most powerful neighbours. Whether this new nation would succeed in holding together a people divided by centuries of bitter warfare is best left for speculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17710;Communist Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17710;Communists have been distributing literature among the working classes in one of our states. They are claiming that the common man needs to rise up against the 'bourgeois' class, and that rule by the workers is the only way they can obtain fair conditions and a truly utopian society. Government officials are concerned, and some say that we need to crack down hard on this kind of talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17715;The Common Man;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17715;Socialist leanings have become quite prevalent in parts of $COUNTRY$, and among these socialists radical ideas have been spreading-- namely that the common man can only achieve true freedom by overthrowing the government and establishing a rule by the working class. They cite the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as tyrannical, and one that will never bend to true reform... and the people have been listening.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME17720;Communist Riot;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17720;The tense situation in one of our states has been aggravated by the presence of communist agitators, spurring on the working classes to rise up against the government and institute a rule by the workers. We could step in, but that might only provoke a rebellion. Allowing the agitators to continue spreading their propaganda, however, might let them get a stronger foothold in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME17730;Communists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17730;A communist demonstration in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, with shouts decrying the state of workers in $COUNTRY$, has gained the communists a great deal of attention and sympathy throughout $STATENAME$. Attempting to crack down on these agitators may only cause the demonstrations to turn into violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18210;The Right to Vote;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18210;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the current enfranchisement offered to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. The discussion so far has been that expanding the voter base has led only to problems, and this bill would tighten the restrictions on voting... to the point where entire groups of people would have their voting rights removed. Passing the bill would no doubt cause problems, but the government seems determined to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18215;Party Loyalty?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18215;A group of the ruling elite in $CAPITAL$ has recently become very concerned at reforms which have made it possible for members of the government to hold views outside of party policies. These reforms have made things too lax, they say, and will ultimately lead to the demise of $COUNTRY$. They've succeeded in gathering enough clout to pass a bill strengthening the power of the party whips, and ensuring that the party's influence in the government remains absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18220;The Right to Information;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18220;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the press. Many feel that the reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ newspapers to become combative with the government, inciting dissension and making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people harder to control. This control is necessary, they say, if $COUNTRY$ is to remain strong and united. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME18225;The Right to Gather;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18225;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the people to gather. Many feel that reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people to become too liberated-- they gather in crowds, protesting the government and otherwise stirring the rest of the rabble. Once upon a time, they say, this simply wouldn't have been allowed. New rules must be put in place to limit the number of people that can meet in one place, and for what purpose. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME18230;Rights of the Opposition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18230;Members of the ruling party have been busy within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, slowly changing small rules that would make it difficult for opposition parties to get recognized and elected. Political boundaries have been shifted, and in some cases members of the opposition have even been harassed. Now it seems a bill has been put before the government which would entrench a large number of these rules, making them permanent. The government is adamant, saying the rules are needed to keep stability in $COUNTRY$, though the bill will no doubt be incredibly unpopular among the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME18501;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Way;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18501;Ours is a nation of equality, where no man is placed above another in importance. Everyone strives for the betterment of all. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a wealthy but criminal industrialist has served not to outrage the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, but rather to reinforce their ideals. Today our people walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18505;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ingenuity;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18506;Ours is a nation of liberty, where every man is born with the inherent right to seek his own destiny. The possibility of prosperity lies within every man's reach. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the acquittal of a man popularly believed to be innocent has served to reinforce our peoples' ideals. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18507;The Price of Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18507;It has been often said that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are accustomed to freedom-- they strive for it, hold it as the greatest of ideals. So it is that they chafe under the yoke of what they see as the government's tyranny. A recent demonstration in one of our cities threatens to spread throughout the state. With the eyes of the world upon us, however, forcefully putting an end to this act of civil disobedience will no doubt be seen as an attack upon our own citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18510;Military Parade;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18510;In the eyes of our soldiers as they parade through the streets, nothing can be seen but utmost devotion to $COUNTRYNAME$ and the ideals for which our nation stands. These men, and the description fits them, have been fostered since childhood into rigid and firm belief in our nation, and they would die to defend it. Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC18511;Ours is a nation of might, where a man's strength determines his success and everyone knows very well how superior we are to our neighbours. None can hope to compare to $COUNTRY$ on our best day. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the execution of a foreigner believed to have been engaged in criminal activities on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soil has served to reinforce our peoples' beliefs. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18515;Send in the Troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18515;Matters in $COUNTRY$ are getting out of hand. Acts of violence are becoming more commonplace, and some claim that revolution is in the air. Many citizens in $CAPITAL$ are calling on the government to take stronger measures. Sending our army to deal with the violence will, however, only bring the attention of the world upon us. Perhaps this is a time to prove that $COUNTRY$ can deal with its affairs in the way we always have-- with civility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18517;Ours is a nation of order, where peace and civility rule the day. Everyone strives for the common good, and for the progress of our nation as a whole. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a prominent criminal figure who had previously eluded authorities has not outraged the people, but rather has served to reinforce their beliefs. Today the people of $COUNTRY$ walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18521;Brotherhood of Man;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18521;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: peace, brotherhood and fraternity. Such were the virtues this man believed in, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18525;Liberty Shines;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18525;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Such were the virtues in which this man believed, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18530;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18531;A recent dispute with one of our neighbours has had an electrifying effect upon the people of $COUNTRY$: 'How can they be allowed to treat us this way?', they ask. Some are calling for war, while others are satisfied with the knowledge that our nation has already come out on top.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18535;Onward to Tomorrow;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18535;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: order, industry and productivity. Such were the virtues in which this man believed, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18540;Charting the Course of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18540;Now that we have embraced westernization, we must choose the path that $COUNTRY$'s people will take in the years to come. What civilized ideal will we hold to?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18550;Rejecting Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18550;Our people have attempted to embrace the ideals of westernization for a long time, but now there is a growing movement to return to the traditional $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. It falls to the nation's leaders to set the example: should we embrace the ideal of tradition once again, or should westernization remain our goal despite our continuing isolation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18551;Embracing Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18551;Our people have held to our traditions for a very long time. After many years of exposure to the western nations, however, a growing movement has begun to change the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. Intellectuals in $CAPITAL$ say the government should lead the people into an era of progress and not remain mired in our backward ways. Shall we throw these fools into prison, or consider what they have to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18555;Clash of Ideals;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18555;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have clashed with members of the aristocracy in $CAPITAL$. The aristocracy has accused the intellectual elite of attempting to cast aside the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life, while the intellectuals say that progress is necessary if $COUNTRY$ is to have any chance against western imperialist powers. The argument of the intellectuals is convincing, but this has not calmed matters in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18556;New Ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18556;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have brought several new ideas before the court, ideas that could advance our research considerably. They are also quite contentious, however, and a rejection of the intellectuals could do much to soothe the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18560;Annals of the Past;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18560;The peasants are taking to the streets, rising up against their rulers in ways that would have been unthinkable only decades ago. Perhaps it is time to remind them of their duty to their nation, and of the traditions which have served $COUNTRY$ so well in ages past?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18561;Celebration in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18561;A great celebration has been held in $CAPITAL$ in honor of $COUNTRY$'s rulers, as well as its centuries of honorable tradition. Massive crowds appeared to cheer on our soldiers, and the spectacle has even drawn the attention of foreigners. Shall we dedicate the celebration to $COUNTRY$'s greatness, or shall we instead use it as an excuse to appease the masses?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18562;The Fight Against Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18562;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionaries have begun heated debates in one of our states, arguing that $COUNTRY$ should not be slavishly seeking to chase after 'civilized' nations-- indeed, that already $COUNTRY$ has gone too far down the path of degradation and that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people suffer for it. They are calling on the government to repeal reforms, or at the very least to slow down the rapid pace of change... and they are gaining a wide audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18565;A Return to Western Influence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18565;$COUNTRY$ is a nation of progress, and our current period of insulation against the western powers runs contrary to that ideal. Shall we call on the borders to be opened once again? It might anger some of our people, but the flow of goods and ideas is invaluable to our prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18571;Rejecting the West?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18571;We never wanted this contact with the westerners. They bring too many problems into our country, and their influence spreads like an insidious disease. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court are calling for the borders to be closed once again, for us to display to these imperialists that they cannot simply strut about our nation as if they own it. A display of force is necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19007;Tensions between ourselves and other Great Powers have erupted regarding dominance over the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We are forced into a position where we must either assert our position, which will be seen as undercutting $FROMCOUNTRY$'s independence, or back down and lose much of the influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ we currently hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME19040;Excavation Rights Requested;Droits de fouille requis;Ausgrabungsrechte beantragt;;Solicitud de derechos de excavación;;;;;;;;;x;;;;,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19040;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has requested excavation rights in the Valley of The Kings. While we ourselves do not have the know how or money to fund a serious excavation of the area, and allowing a foreign contractor might be good for that reason, it might also be best to let the secrets of our proud nation's history lie undisturbed until such a time when we ourselves can find them. Turning down a foreign power will spoil our relations, though.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;,,,,,,,

EVTDESC19365;An idea has been spreading among the people of $COUNTRY$... some of our lands are under foreign control, but it appears to be beyond our power to regain them on our own. $COUNTRY$ has a great power as its benevolent protector, however, does it not?

Already the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are up in arms over this imposition by a foreign power, though some are clearly questioning whether there is anything to be done. $COUNTRY$ did not submit willingly, after all, and if a rebellion breaks us free of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ control would they not simply invade once again? Perhaps $COUNTRY$ has suffered enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME20110;Natives in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20110;A recent demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought attention to the plight of natives in $STATENAME$, namely to their oppression by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and their demands for independence. If something isn't done soon we may be facing intervention by foreign powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME20111;Trouble in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20111;A recent riot in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought a great deal of attention to $STATENAME$-- the kind that would normally prompt the great powers to consider intervention. It seems, however, that the demands for independence by 'uncivilized' peoples has largely fallen on deaf ears. News of the trouble has faded away as quickly as it began.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME20112;Long Memories;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20112;While recent trouble in $STATENAME$ has raised the spectre of foreign intervention once again, there are many who remember the last crisis over $STATENAME$'s people as if it were yesterday. Try as they might, the world is simply not ready to listen to them again-- yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME20115;Incident in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20115;A demonstration by $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ quickly got out of hand as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers shot into the crowd to disperse it. A riot ensued, and several protestors were slain. Throughout $STATENAME$, the reaction has been one of outrage-- and there is an effort by some $PROVINCECULTURE$ malcontents to draw the attention of the world, just one more example of $COUNTRY$'s disregard for peace and civilized behavior-- or so they'll say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31515;The Greater Germany Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME31516;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Petitions to Join Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers-- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Is Greater Germany worth the possibility of war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME36960;The Gold Coast Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36960;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us with the hopes of negotiating a treaty. They want to solidify control over the Gold Coast in Africa, specifically by annexing our colony at Sekondi. In return, they will recognize our colonial holdings elsewhere and encourage greater cooperation between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46605;The Argentine Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46605;Unrest is stirring against the Rosas dictatorship in Argentina, with liberals demanding a constitution and a trasition to democratic rule. Justo José de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios, has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and asked us to support an uprising should Rosas refuse the liberal demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46610;The Constitutional Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46610;General Justo José de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios, has turned against the Rosas government and demanded that it submit to liberal demands for a new constitution. There are hints that neighboring governments might support Urquiza, and that should he rise up in rebellion against us they will intervene on his behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46611;The Argentine Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46611;With Rosas unable to defeat the Entre Rios rebellion, he has been forced to flee Argentina and General Urquiza has assumed temporary control of the government. Meeting with liberals in Santa Fe, they have drawn up a new constitution which has created an Argentine Republic. The Buenos Aires province is displeased and vows to resist,but the wind of change is clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46612;General Urquiza Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46612;The rebellion in Entre Rios has been put down, and both General Urquiza and his liberal supporters have been captured and executed. The Argentine states have submitted to the will of Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49501;Reforming the Kalmar Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49501;Members of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government have approached us, suggesting that the Kalmar Union must be ressurrected. For the moment, this is simply an idea, a suggestion that the Scandinavian nations should work together towards an eventual union. If we disagree, it's possible that the idea dies here. If we don't, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might be mortally insulted. If Scandinavians are to take their rightful place in Europe, however, perhaps there is merit in their proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTOPTA49501;A royal marriage cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB49501;We see little reason to join such a union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ proposal. It is now in our hands whether to let the Union die here and now, or force $FROMCOUNTRY$  to join us whether they like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA49502;Oh well, I guess that's over then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB49502;We'll see how they feel with an army in their capital...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49503;Form a Customs Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49503;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed the next logical step in our mutual cooperation: a customs union between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$, indeed all of Scandinavia, which would remove the restrictions on trade between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA49503;A customs union cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB49503;This is going too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49504;Form a Political Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has suggested a political union between their country and $COUNTRY$, arguing that this is the next logical step for Scandinavia's security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA49504;It seems like a logical argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB49504;This is going too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49505;Norway Asks For Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49505;Your Norwegian subjects seek to establish their own independent kingdom. The other European powers support their independence, and will be upset if we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49506;Norway Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49506;This time they are not asking nicely. Independence or war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME49509;The Leadership of Kalmar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49509;As our power in Scandinavia wanes and $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence grows, so does the focus of the union move to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME60160;Birth of a Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60160; Today crowds gathered in $CAPITAL$ to celebrate $COUNTRY$'s independence. In the modern world, independence can be a fleeting thing-- so we must enjoy it while we can. Today, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags wave from every window and corner, and jubilant citizens sing the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ anthem. It is a heartfelt theme that speaks of better tomorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME66689;Lucky Nations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC66689;Sometimes in this world, nations seem to be blessed by God in certain periods. Their leaders are brilliant, their people are hardy, they excel in warfare, produce amazing works of culture, and their economies boom. Do we live in such a world? If Lucky Nations are turned on, ten random civilized nations who are not Great Powers and five random uncivilized nations will be given special bonuses that will enable them to shake up the status quo of the world by giving them significant bonuses.;;;;;;x,,,,

EVTNAME80120;Hui Unrest in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC80120;Though tolerant of religious practices, the Hui Muslims in $PROVINCENAME$ are resentful of discrimination by the Qin government. Unrest in the province has stirred up anti-Manchu sentiment, even among non-Muslims. The violence is threatening to spread throughout all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME80121;Panthay Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC80121;Have Peace with Han Chinese!\nDown with Qin court!\n\nA rebellion has erupted in the southern province of Yunnan, led by a rebel named Du Wenxiu. The man's forces have already captured Dali and driven out the Qin governor, forcing our government to deal with the matter directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME80122;Panthay Rebellion Crushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC80122;With Qin forces marching into Kunming, the Panthay Rebellion is officially over. The rebels and their leaders have been routed, and already measures are being taken to ensure there are no further disturbances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME80123;Panthay Rebellion Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC80123;We have driven the hated Manchu from Yunnan. At last, victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME80125;Dungan Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC80125;With Muslim-led unrest existing throughout the province on Xinjiang, a Tajik adeventurer by the name of Yaqub Beg has led rebels to seize the capital of Kashgar and has driven Qin governors away. The situation in the frontier appears to be out of hand, with these Muslims having declared an independent state and full Jihad against the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME80126;Dungan Revolt Crushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC80126;With Qin forces marching into Kashgar, the Dungan Revolt is officially over. The rebels and their leaders have been routed, and already measures are being taken to ensure there are no further disturbances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME85010;The Ganghwa Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85010;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal Korean fortress. In a fury, our ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle the Koreans on land. After victory, they returned home-- but word of the assault has spread. This is yet another example of Korea flaunting its disrespect for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authority. Many within the government are suggesting we demand not only an apology, but force a treaty upon the Koreans which will see their nation forced to open itself to our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC85011;A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, their ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle our forces on land. They returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to demand compensation-- in the form of an unequal treaty requiring $COUNTRY$ be opened to their influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC85012;A Japanese vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, the Japanese ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle Korean forces on land. The Japanese returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now we hear tale that they have forced the Koreans to sign an unequal treaty in consequence... one which has forced them to sever tributary ties to $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME85015;Korean Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85015;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of Japanese armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated Japanese terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85020;Tonghak Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85020;With increasing frustration against government corruption and foreign influence in $COUNTRY$, a rebel movement has appeared among followers of the Tonghak or 'Eastern Learning' ideology. They have been stirring up the peasant classes, forming poorly-armed if numerous armies to purge the capital and rid the country of Japanese and other foreign presence. We will need to move quickly if we wish to prevent them from overthrowing the government or causing an incident with neighbouring powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85021;Tonghak Rebellion Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85021;The unrest caused by the Tonghak movement appears to be coming to an end. The militant leaders have vanished into the countryside, and their followers have dispersed. Order is restored-- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85025;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence. This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea-- many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME85026;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Intervenes in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85026;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there. The only sensible move is to send in forces to overthrow the Korean government and replace it with one that is more firmly pro-Japanese-- despite the conflict this will all but certainly spark with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME85027;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Forces Enter Seoul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85027;Reacting to reports that the Chinese are planning to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered $CAPITAL$ and captured the Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. Pro-Japanese supporters have been installed in the new government, effectively rendering us a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal. Both rebels and loyalist forces throughout the country have reacted in rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85028;Responding to news of our intended intervention, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered Seoul and captured the Korean Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. A pro-Japanese government has been installed, effectively rendering Korea a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal, with orders to end any agreements and alliances with $COUNTRY$ and ban our forces from entering their nation. This is, of course, an insult of the highest magnitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME85029;Chinese Intervene in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85029;Reacting to the Tonghak uprising, the Chinese have moved forces into Korea-- entering $CAPITAL$ and effectively setting up a government under their complete control in a swift coup. That there has been no reaction from the Japanese government is surprising, just as it is frustrating that our embattled armies have had no chance to agree to this so-called 'help' from the Chinese. Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85030;The rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless. Considering that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stands by doing nothing, refusing Korean appeals for help, it seems we are in a position to act-- some are suggesting that we engineer a pro-Japanese coup in Seoul to install a government more firmly in our control, and prevent any possibility of an overthrow eliminating our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME90110;The Manifesto de Montecristi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90110;Jose Martí, a Cuban intellectual and radical who has spent a great deal of time organizing émigrés in the United States, has returned to the colony and declared the Manifesto de Monticristi, an exposition of the purposes and principles of the coming Cuban revolution. It seems the uprising has been in the planning for some time, and if the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government intends to remain in control of Cuba it could have a battle ahead of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME90120;The Propaganda Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90120;Three Filipino priests have been executed in the Manila, charged with subversion. While the executions are said to have been just, they are now considered martyrs by the Filipino people and have inspired the creation of a literary and organization known as 'the Propaganda Movement'. The organization consists of Filipino émigrés in the Netherlands, primarily liberals and students, who are attempting to increase awareness of the needs of the Phillipines and foster better relations between Holland and its colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME90125;The Katipunan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90125;We have received reports from colonial officers in Manila regarding rumors of a secret organization called the 'Katipunan'. Formed by anti-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Filipinos, they reportedly seek complete independence for the Phillipines. It's possible that limited home rule might mollify some of these revolutionaries, but nothing short of freedom will satisfy them for long. Tracking them down among sympathetic locals may prove difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90135;The Grito de Lares;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90135;With conditions in our Puerto Rican colony so poor, the notion of independence has begun to spread among the local Caribenos. Reports from the colonial governor state a revolt has begun in the town of Lares, one that may be difficult to put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90140;The Intentona de Yauco;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90140;We have received reports of an independence movement having been formed in Puerto Rico, with an uprising having been organized in the town of Yauco. While the movement doesn't yet have a great deal of support among local conservatives, many of whom are hoping there is still a chance to achieve independence from $COUNTRY$ through peaceful means, it's possible that their efforts could spread if we don't put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTDESC95505;European presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses-- but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95506;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95506;Our presence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached the point where $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence is felt in every level of their society. They are a protectorate in all but name, and the time has come for us to determine whether that status should be made official. Shall we agree to make $FROMCOUNTRY$ a protectorate and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, or support their independence as a friendly ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95507;Nationals Expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95507;A disturbing report has reached us of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence-- meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority. There are some who say this is a golden opportunity to establish a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate, while others say $FROMCOUNTRY$ is simply not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95508;The Sale of Assab;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95508;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ shipping company has come into the ownership of the Red Sea port of Assab, sold to them by a local Afar sultan. The port would make for an excellent coaling station, and perhaps even provide a base for $COUNTRY$ to expand our influence in the area. Pushing for more direct control, however, could cause tensions with Assab's owner-- who might feel they have greater right to the port than the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC95509;The Red Sea port of Assab has been sold to $FROMCOUNTRY$ by the local Afar sultan. They have begun to use the port as a coaling station, and fears within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are that they will use this base to expand their influence within $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95510;Rebellion in Eritrea;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95510;With the Sudan in chaos, the Ethiopians have taken advantage of the situation to regain control over the Eritrean coastlands. Though we may yet regain control over the Sudan, we should consider whether the Eritreans must be punished for this trespass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC95512;The 'Age of Princes' is upon us. The rulers of Ethiopia must struggle to unite the land under a single Emperor-- and now it is $COUNTRY$'s time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them-- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTDESC95599;We are the original inhabitants of this land, and we have managed to survive and even prosper despite the aggression of our alien neighbours. We do not share their values or their mores, and we do not want them to invade our earth, in war or in peace. We do not allow outsiders to immigrate to our land, nor do they want to come.

EVTNAME96165;Italian Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96165;The Italians have managed to unify at long last, threatening $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the region. We will have to decide whether it is in our best interests to object or to make friends with the new rulers. What has been done cannot now be undone, after all, and a united Italy could be a formidable enemy or a powerful $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTDESC96170;$COUNTRY$ has become the center of Italian nationalism, its people calling out for unification.

EVTNAME97000;The Revolution of Maria de Fonte;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97000;A growing dissatisfaction with the ruling government among Portugal's poor has grown into rebellion, spurred on by popular discontent with the prohibition against burials inside churches. The instigator of the initial riots is a woman by the name of Maria, and her nickname has come to be used to represent the rebellion-- which has a large contingent of peasant women among its supporters -- and which has been co-opted by revolutionaries in emulation of the rebellions elsewhere in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97001;Peasant Revolt in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97001;The Maria de Fonte rebellion has spread to $PROVINCENAME$, with the lower classes rising up in opposition to the ruling government. Many are calling for the government's resignation, and there are signs that Queen Maria II may engineer a coup to restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97002;End of the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97002;Portuguese forces have managed to restore order in the countryside, and the peasantry have been brought back under control. The danger of a royal coup has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97003;The Emboscada;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97003;Spurred on by the spreading revolts in Portugal, Queen Maria II has suspended the constitution and installed a reactionary government presided over by João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha. This has served to spur on the country's liberals to outrage, and begun talk of civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97015;Regicide of King Carlos I;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97015;Upon returning to Lisbon from a brief trip abroad, King Carlos I and the royal family had their carriage fired upon by republican activists as they passed through the Terreiro do Paço. Three of the bullets struck and killed the King, while another fatally wounded the heir to the throne, Luis Filipe. During the turmoil, the police killed the assassins... but the King and the royal heir were not saved and were pronounced dead at the Naval Arsenal soon afterwards. Manuel, the king's youngest son, has been quickly acclaimed as the new King of Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME97020;The Republican Coup D'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97020;With the monarchy already weakened by the death of King Carlos, republican opponents have been able to gather considerable support in the capital. Members of the Carbonária, republican youth, and elements of the army have instigated a coup d'état in the palace. The young King Manuel and his family have reportedly escaped for exile to England, and only days later a new Portuguese Republic has been declared in Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME97076;Settling Tarauaca;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97076;The jungles of Tarauaca lie in the heart of the Amazon, and rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$. Currently there are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ settlers eager for the opportunity to settle the region and have asked for the funds to assist them, though advisors say this may cause problems with neighboring states who also claim the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97080;Occupation of Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97086;Pacification of $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97086;Through the judicious use of force, confiscation of native lands and the introduction of roads and other vestiges of civilization, conditions in $PROVINCENAME$ have greatly improved. The native patagonians are proving to be contentious, but their numbers are far too few for us to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97090;The Argentina-Chile Border Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97090;Now that the lands of Araucania and Patagonia are fully settled, the Argentinians have approached us to work out a border treaty. They intend to claim the lands east of the Andes and are willing to concede the lands east of the Andes to us. If we do not come to an agreement, future conflict is almost guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97091;Settling the Interior;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97091;The lands away from the coast are sparsely populated, and there are surely good farmlands to settle, resources to harvest, or wonders to be seen. It is our right, nay, our duty to claim our share, lest our greedy neighbours take all of wealth of this vast continent for themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC97095;Our outsider neighbours seek to take land for themselves and deprive our native brothers of their lives and livelihoods. We cannot yet openly combat them, but at least we can stake our own claims – as much as we abhor sinking to their level – so that we may protect those brothers who live outside of our borders already. And so that we may help them to better defend themselves against the alien robbers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME97170;The Mahdist Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97170;A Sudanese religious leader by the name of Muhammad Ahmad has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or 'guided one') and begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism-- and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97171;Mahdists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The religious leader's jihad against foreigners has sparked a local rebellion, one that the authorities have had a difficult time putting down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97181;Colonial Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97181;We have lost control of the situation in $STATENAME$. The rebels have gained sufficient control that they have ejected the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors and declared their independence... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97561;Rebels in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97561;With our forces off valiantly facing the enemy, rebels have taken advantage of the situation and stormed $CAPITAL$. They have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and already done a great deal of damage in order to drive out foreign influence in $COUNTRY$. Without the forces to oppose them, there is little we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97562;$CAPITAL$ Burns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97562;$CAPITAL$ has been taken by the enemy, and a great deal of $COUNTRY$ is lost to our control. Many are saying that we only continue the war because our foreign masters insist that we do so, and that the time has come for us to let go of these ties-- no matter the consequences. Perhaps they are right, though it seems the situation is dire for $COUNTRY$'s future no matter what we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97566;Trouble in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97566;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is besieged by rebels, and threatens to fall if they do not receive assistance from $COUNTRY$. They warn us that if the rebels are successful, it's very likely that $FROMCOUNTRY$ would cease to be in $COUNTRY$'s sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97600;Sakoku;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97600;Meaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME97601;Rangaku;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima. Despite the enforced isolation of the nation, this policy of learning allowed western influences to spread-- particularly in the southern domains of Satsuma and Choshu.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97609;We have formally concluded a treaty with the Japanese which will see our influence restored, and our demands for their ports to be opened to our ships to be met. Additionally, an indemnity will be placed upon their government to make up for the expense of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97610;The Japanese Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97610;Despite the overwhelming odds against them, the Japanese have refused our generous offer of surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97615;Sonno Joi;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97615;'Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians!'\n\nThis is the slogan chanted by neo-confucian activists, reacting to the Tokugawa shogunate's opening of Japan to foreigners. There have been growing reports of violence all over the country, primarily against foreign visitors and statesmen but also against the shogunate itself. Each incident chips away at Tokugawa control over the daimyo and erodes relations with the western powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97616;$PROVINCENAME$ Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97616;There has been an incident in $PROVINCENAME$ where samurai, acting under the political slogan of 'Sonno Joi', have committed violence against foreigners conducting business in $STATENAME$. The incident has affected the Tokugawa shogunate's relations with foreign powers, as well as incited locals into riot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97617;Order to Expel the Barbarians;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97617;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, is a challenge to the shogunate's power, and may serve to further incite rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97618;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, and is a challenge to the shogunate's power. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan must decide whether it supports the Emperor's edict or quietly opposes it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97620;The Death of Iesada;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi-- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME97621;Tokugawa Yoshinobu is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME97623;Tokugawa Iemochi is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama. It is becoming increasingly clear that a larger change is necessary. Perhaps the time has come for the Emperor to rule Japan, a single leader to bring the nation into this new era?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97624;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Iemochi as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada.

EVTNAME97625;Sakuradamon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97625;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point. Many are urging that a policy of Kobu Gattai-- a union of the bakufu and the imperial court-- may be required.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, and thus the bakufu has begun a compromise policy of Kobu Gattai-- a union of the bakufu and the imperial court.

Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, yet the shogunate refuses to compromise with the imperial court. Many are certain this will only speed up the coming conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97630;The Death of Emperor Komei;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97630;There are some who believe that Emperor Komei was assassinated-- delivered a handkerchief laced with smallpox, perhaps by radicals who fear the possibility of compromise between the bakufu and the imperial court. No matter the truth, the death of the Emperor has placed the young Emperor Meiji upon the imperial throne and eliminated any chance of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97635;Opposition to the Bakufu;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97635;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. Officials within the bakufu are urging that we seek allies among either the outsider tozama or the traditional fudai, to strengthen the shogunate's position. Approaching one means angering the other, of course, but it appears we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC97636;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers.

EVTNAME97640;The Meiji Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97640;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over all of Japan.

EVTDESC97641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have seized control of the palace at Kyoto and declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over Japan.

EVTDESC97642;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over all of Japan.

EVTNAME97648;A New Capital in the East?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97648;While Kyoto has long been the capital of Japan, and home to the Imperial Court, the city of Edo has become the de facto capital-- for centuries it has been the center of shogunate power, as well as a cultural and administrative center. The Emperor will need to decide whether the court should move to Edo and create a new capital... or remain in Kyoto and revitalize it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97650;We Are Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97650;The Imperial palace at Kyoto has been occupied, and our daimyo allies are on the retreat.

EVTNAME97651;Tokugawa Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97652;The Tokugawa shogunate has once again asserted control over Japan. A bakufu messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our submission to direct rule from Edo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97605;More 'black ships' have appeared off our shores, these ones commanded by an American named Commodore Matthew Perry. The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku-- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME97660;The Taisho Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97660;With the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan's old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted. Students, university professors and journalists inspired by Western schools of thought have organized public demonstrations to demand new reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME97665;The Satsuma Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion. Led by one of the most prestigious samurai leaders of the former Satsuma Domain, Saigo Takamori, the rebellion has attracted a large number of followers and will be a severe challenge for the Japanese government to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97670;The Northern Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97670;The islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings on Hokkaido, and we must seek to claim these places before the Russians do so first.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97673;The Path of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97673;$COUNTRY$ has followed a militaristic path until now, determined to set ourselves against our neighbours in the interest of security-- while risking that security with dangerous wars. The new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has determined that this must change. We must follow a path of progress, and instead devote outselves to technology and westernization if we are to remain free and whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97674;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97674;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has followed a policy of progress and westernization until now, hoping that advancing $COUNTRY$ to match the Western powers would keep us safe. We now see this is in error, and that only by an aggressive expansion of our borders can we hope to maintain the security of $COUNTRY$ proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97675;China in Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97675;The Chinese have fallen into warring factions, all but crumbling their power and leaving us an advantage we would be fools not to exploit. The Line of Advantage policy dictates that we should strike, and strike soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97676;War With $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97676;Believing $COUNTRY$ to be weak, the hated Japanese have decided to strike at us and take control of our government. They shall find us a difficult target!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97677;The Korean Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97677;Our nation's policy of the Line of Advantage dictates that we must expand our borders if we are to maintain security. Naturally, our most vulnerable point lies in neighbouring Korea. They must either be brought under our direct control or made into a vassal if $COUNTRY$ is to be kept safe. Already $COUNTRY_ADJ$ generals are clamoring for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97678;The Formosa Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97678;The recent murder of Japanese sailors off the coast of Formosa has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97679;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97679;After the recent murders of a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ sailors off the coast of Formosa, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has delivered a demand: turn over the island, for the sake of their security, or it shall be war between $FROMCOUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$. We know this is just an excuse for their militarist expansion... but can we stand up against their might?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97700;Patriot Rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97700;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in $FROMCOUNTRY$, and have gained control of the capital. They send word they wish to bring all our lost provinces back to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98100;The Ladder Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98100;The treatment of slaves in Cuba has become increasingly harsh after recent unrest, culminating in the so-called 'Ladder Conspiracy' which relates to a method of torture involving tying a slave to a ladder and whipping them until they confess or die. Reformists in the colony have been calling for a change in Spanish policy and an end to the slave trade there. Failure to do so could result in more uprisings, but bowing to such pressure could have serious repercussions back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98105;The Cry of Yara;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98105;Cuban sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes has issued the 'Grito de Yara', the 'Cry of Yara', declaring Cuban independence from $COUNTRY$ and freedom for his slaves. The man has many followers, and his call has spread rapidly throughout the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98300;War-Time Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98301;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98302;Anger Against the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems-- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98303;Contentious Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98304;Government Supporters Rally;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98305;Orderly Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly. Debates are being carried out in the usual manner, and there are no reports of violence in $CAPITAL$ or elsewhere. Supporters of the ruling regime have turned out in force, as have the hopefuls seeking to defeat the current government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98310;Conservatives Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98400;The Jewish Diaspora;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98400;Now that a true Jewish homeland has been established, Israel will begin to draw many Jewish people who live in countries across the world-- though this will inevitably anger many neighboring Islamic countries who object to its presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98405;The Jewish Homeland;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
"EVTDESC98405;Jewish families in $PROVINCENAME$, having originally arrived in $COUNTRY$ as a result of the diaspora,"" are reportedly planning on emigrating to Israel-- the newly-established Jewish homeland in the Palestine. We could encourage them to remain, but that might not be a simple matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x"",,,,,,,,"
EVTNAME98600;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98600;There has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war. Any attempts to achieve independence should ideally take a diplomatic route first, with friendly ties maintained if peaceful separation becomes a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98605;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98605;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand. Still others say that if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is denied, we could be facing a rebellion-- and is it not better than to have a friendly ally than a recalcitrant and unwilling subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME98606;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98606;Not unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion-- as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98607;$COUNTRY$ Granted Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98607;Our diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98610;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98610;It appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence-- or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98611;Must We Fight Alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98612;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME98650;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Unification!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98650;The call from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to $COUNTRY$, asking us to unify with their nation into a greater state-- one which will forge a greater power in a new world order. There are those $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who fear losing our identity in such a union, but many welcome the nation and rightly state that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s influence in $COUNTRY$ is already great. If we deny the union, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government may decide to enforce their claim on us whether we like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98725;The Call for Arab Unity;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98725;The call has gone out across the world: a nation has risen to lead the Arab masses into the future, a greater power that can withstand the onslaught of colonialism by the European powers. They must rise up and join $COUNTRY$, or forever spend their lives as servants to foreign masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME160003;Truce With the Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the 'Heavenly Kingdom', the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness.

EVTDESC160004;Though we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory.

EVTNAME160006;The War Against Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160006;The continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarassment to the Qin government and our Emperor.

There will be considerable resistance, but the Emperor has decreed that the Heavenly Kingdom must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160007;The War Against the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160007;The truce with the Qin Emperor has come to an end, and already the calls have begun for the Taiping Revolution to continue. The Manchu must be thrown down! All of China must be freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC160009;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Qin Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160011;The Female Shortage;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160012;Taiping Missionaries in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160012;We have received reports of Christian missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.

There are sightings of their pamphlets all over $STATENAME$ now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160013;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160013;To many people in China, the Qin Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south.

EVTDESC160017;Followers of the 'Heavenly Kingdom' are causing further problems in the south.

EVTDESC160025;Our beloved leader, the glorious and most holy Hong Xiuquan, has passed away-- ascended into Heaven to receive his just rewards from God. Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power. Others say that Hong Tianguifu is a buffoon and that a proper republic is the way forward. Still others say the unthinkable-- that Hong Xiuquan's death is a sign that the Heavenly Kingdom has lost favor with God, and that the only way to restore it is restore the Qin Dynasty to the Imperial throne-- without, of course, allowing the Manchu to rule the south like errant lapdogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME160026;Retreat to Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC164504;The man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south.

Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisifed to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide.

EVTDESC810057;The old $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime leftover from our days as a colony are now over-- $COUNTRY$ is once more an African nation, truly belonging to the people who have lived here since long before the Europeans arrived.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316081;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316081;A drunken riot by a large group of British sailors ashore at Kowloon has resulted in the death of a local man. By rights, the sailors should be tried and executed by the Qin magistrate. The British, however, have demanded extraterritoriality-- meaning their citizens would be tried by British judges. This will inevitably lead to their release and the anger of our citizens, but demanding these mens' executions could lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316083;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316083;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us a concession port on their coast as well as reparations. This has improved relations between our countries tremendously, and should go a long way to ensuring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in China remains strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316084;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused to submit. The war must go on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316085;The Treaty of Shimonoseki;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316085;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not going well. The damnable Japanese are in our lands and blockading our ports, and to the embarassment of our government there seems to be little we can do to stop them. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached us to negotiate a 'fair' settlement-- hand over Formosa and pay reparations. While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them what they want, though the loss to our prestige would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316086;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316086;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us Formosa as well as reparations. This has improved relations between our countries tremendously, and should go a long way to ensuring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Asia remains strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316175;We have lost all patience with the barbarians who call themselves our 'masters'. They ignore our laws, our customs, and force themselves upon the generosity of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ throne at every opportunity. It is time we turned them out, refused them their free reign in our lands and ports, and demonstrated the true might of our Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316176;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Envoy Ejected;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316176;Relations have been cool with $FROMCOUNTRY$, laced with bitterness over our nation's superiority. Lately the situation has reached a boiling point, and we have received a report that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ envoy to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ court has been ejected. Indeed, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals throughout $FROMCOUNTRY$ are reporting harassment and outright violence. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ are being refused berth at Chinese harbors. This is a systematic campaign by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ emperor to reduce our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316180;Empire of the Great Qin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316180;China has no need for, nor interest in, foreigners and their gifts no matter how ingenious they may be. It is only due to the emperor's generosity that foreigners are allowed to trade at all, and all such trade must take place at our will. The yi barbarians should tremble as they obey us and show no negligence! Barbarians shall bow down before the Chinese emperor in the manner customary for tributary envoys.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316181;The Arrow Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316181;Qin officials recently boarded the Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship (a lorcha) that was suspected of piracy and smuggling. Twelve Chinese crew members were arrested on suspicion of piracy by the Qin authorities. British officials have demanded the release of the sailors, however, claiming that because the ship had recently been British-registered, it was under their protection. The Imperial court has been enraged by this claim, suggesting that agreeing to British demands would give smugglers free reign throughout China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC1316182;Qin officials recently boarded the Arrow, a ship that-- according to all reports-- was flying British colors at the time. The Chinese claim this isn't the case, and we've received news that they intend to crack down on the opium trade throughout the Empire. The British government is up in arms, saying that we must exert our influence over the Qin if we are to retain our position in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131709;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131709;An incident that began with drunken sailors murdering a Chinese man has escalated into a larger crisis with the Qin government. We have insisted that these sailors be tried by a British judge-- the barbaric Chinese judicial system would result in these men getting anything but a fair trial. The chinese have demanded the men be turned over, and what's more that they be given the right to punish British citizens as needed. The confrontation has resulted in larger trade sanctions being applied against British merchants, and threats of worse. Our prestige as an Empire to be reckoned with is being threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131710;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131710;In a display of diplomatic force, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have forced $COUNTRY$ to sign a treaty with them, forcing numerous trade as well as territory concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131711;The Simla Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131711;British diplomats have approached the Tibet government, hoping to broker a peaceful arrangement between Tibet and China now that Tibet is independent. No doubt they intend to gain influence and territory in our nation, as well as an ally against Chinese aggression,, but the prospect of war should the negotiations fail seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC131712;British diplomats have approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, hoping to broker a peaceful arrangement between Tibet and $COUNTRY$ now that Tibet is independent. No doubt they intend to gain influence and territory in Tibet, as well as an ally against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aggression,, but the prospect of war should the negotiations fail seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME131713;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131713;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have agreed to the arrangements made at the Simla Convention, and our relations with them have improved as a result-- not to mention our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131714;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131714;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused the arrangements made at the Simla Convention, and our relations with them have cooled as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131715;The New Army;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131715;Our efforts to modernize the Beiyang army have borne fruit, but this has necessitated the division of authority among regional forces. The generals in charge of these forces, 'warlords' as some call them, have been gaining a great deal of power. They are part of the Beiyang Army, but fight amongst themselves... And, far worse, are critical of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We will need to watch these generals carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME131720;Spread of Anhui Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131720;Warlord influence has begun to spread into $STATENAME$. These generals are still loyal to $COUNTRY$, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that they are taking control of a significant portion of the country. Officials in $CAPITAL$ are alarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131721;Spread of Guangdong Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131722;Spread of Guangxi Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131723;Spread of Hunan Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME131729;Spread of Xinjiang Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131730;The Warlord Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131730;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority. What began with several of the outlying warlords declaring their indepedence has ended with the most powerful generals in the Beiyang Army struggling for control. A contest has begun regarding who will control the future of China's destiny, and most are certain it will not be long before the entire nation is engulfed in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131735;The Struggle for China;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131735;Now that we are free, we must choose where we stand in the ensuing struggle for the nation's destiny: either side with the Kuomintang and fight for domination of the republic or side with the Beiyang and fight for domination of a united China. Alternatively, we can declare our neutrality in the conflict and let the chips fall where they may.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131736;The Guominjun Clique;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131736;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general by the name of Feng Yuxiang has betrayed his superiors and broken off from the Beiyang armies. He and his supporters have taken the territory under their control and formed a new clique, swearing to topple the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131740;Leader of the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131740;The leaders of the Kuomintang are preparing for their drive on Beijing, and $COUNTRY$ is expected to answer the call. Either we side with Nationalist China now, or we must abandon the Kuomintang cause and seek our own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Joins the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has answered the call, and will unite their forces with ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131742;The War of Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131742;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are crying out for the nation to once again unify. We must gather our strength and strike out at those who would divide China, leaving it weak for foreigners to prey upon. Already the banners are in the streets, and $COUNTRY$'s generals are saying now is the time to launch an offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131743;War with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131743;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ army is massing on our mutual border, ready to make a massive offensive into $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. It seems a war is upon us, whether we like it or not: either they destroy us or we destroy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131745;Chinese Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131745;The call has come from the capital: the era of warlords is over, and all the Chinese peoples must unite under a single flag. This means $COUNTRY$ must either submit to Beijing's rule or face more war against a strong and unified foe. Your generals stand ready to receive your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131746;The Island of Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131746;Now that we own the island of Formosa, the local Min population has begun to organize itself-- presumably towards the end of breaking away from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800012;Intervention in $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800012;We have been secretly approached by certain members within the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, suggesting that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention to free them from foreign control might be in both our interests. $FROMCOUNTRY$ would be free to seek its own destiny, while $COUNTRY$ would gain an ally. The catch, of course, is that the attempt could look like interference to the rest of the world... and earn us the enmity of $FROMCOUNTRY$'s rulers in particular. If we make the attempt, we should learn of the results within a week at the most.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME800013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800013;A foreign power has meddled in the affairs of $FROMCOUNTRY$, taking advantage of the unrest there to engineer a coup which has freed them from our control. Our trusted servants in that nation have been either arrested or expelled, and now the world watches for our response.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800014;A foreign power has meddled in the affairs of $FROMCOUNTRY$, taking advantage of the unrest there to engineer a coup which has freed them from our control. Our trusted servants in that nation have been either arrested or expelled, and now the world watches for our response.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800015;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses to Intervene;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800015;The answer from $FROMCOUNTRY$ is clear: they won't intervene in our internal affairs. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800016;Intervention Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800016;$FROMCOUNTRY$ attempted to intervene, but the resulting orgy of violence in $CAPITAL$ has failed to drive out the influence of our overlord. Worse, it has resulted in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ being greatly damaged, as many see them as instigators rather than would-be liberators.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800017;Free At Great Cost;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800017;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has supported the coud d'etat in $CAPITAL$, but with the change came an orgy of violence that has seen $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ damaged along with that of our overlord. Many people in $COUNTRY$ are left with hard feelings, and see $FROMCOUNTRY$ as an instigator rather than a liberator. What will come next depends entirely on whether reprisals will come our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800018;Free At Last!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800018;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention has succeeded in freeing our government from foreign rule. After an orgy of violence in $CAPITAL$, citizens are celebrating in the streets. $COUNTRY$ has a new destiny as a truly independent nation... provided no reprisals come out way, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800021;Attempted Coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800021;A foreign power attempted to use their influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ to take advantage of the unrest there and free them from our control. Their efforts have come to naught, and their agents have been arrested and many of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ malcontents exposed and imprisoned. The question remains, however, as to what we will do in response to this outrage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800022;Attempt Thwarted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800022;Our attempt to interfere in $FROMCOUNTRY$'s government was thwarted. We have lost influence there, and angered their overlord. This may lead to war, but we will have to wait and see what develops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800023;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Freed At Great Cost;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800023;Our attempt to engineer a coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$ was successful, but at the cost of a great deal of our influence there. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is angry, and it's possible their overlords may attempt to retaliate either against them or against us. We will have to wait and see what develops of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800024;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800024;Our attempt to engineer a coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$ was successful, and they are now an independent country as well as a useful ally. It's possible their overlords may attempt to retaliate either against them or against us. We shall have to wait and see what develops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880130;Reactionary Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880130;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionary party. Aristocrats have allegedly been receiving payments and other illegal benefits for supporting the cause, while the party leader is shown to have made a fortune with sensitive national information. This has been declared beyond the pale even by reactionary supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the reactionary cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880140;Conservative Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880140;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ conservative party. Party leaders were allegedly paid secretly by local land owners to tweak laws in their favor, governmental positions given to favorites, goods stolen from  government warehouses - the list goes on and on. This has been declared beyond the pale even by conservative supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the conservative cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME880150;Liberal Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880150;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberal party. Popular candidates have allegedly been involved in smuggling of illicit goods, used questionable tactics to buy votes and speculated on investments with government funds. This has been declared beyond the pale even by liberal supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the liberal cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880160;Anarcho-Liberal Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880160;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ anarcho-liberal party. Several wealthy businessmen evaded taxes with the help of party members, who in return received kickbacks and a great deal of illegal funding for the party. This has been declared beyond the pale even by anarcho-liberal supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severly damaging the anarcho-liberal cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880170;Socialist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880170;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist party. Illegal union activity, blackmail of important citizens, mistreatment of servants - the facts speak for themselves. This has been declared beyond the pale even by socialist supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely hurting the socialist cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME880180;Communist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880180;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ communist party. While preaching water for the masses, important communist party officals appear to drink wine. Police has secured several party coffers filled with dirty money from illegal activities, stolen art and conterfeit documents. This has been declared beyond the pale even by communist supporters, severely hurting the communist cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME880190;Fascist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880190;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ fascist party. A militant group associated with the fascists was revealed to have murdered several socialist politicians, tortured priests and attempted to burn the mansion of a wealthy minority leader. This has been declared beyond the pale even by fascist supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severly damaging the fascist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880200;Grave Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880200;As more and more evidence against the ruling party has come to light, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it has no choice but to resign and call an election. The decision was made after several weeks of heated debate, and it is already well-known that certain members of the government-- those most sorely hit by the scandal-- have been repudiated by the ruling party and will not be seeking re-election. How this will affect the government's chances is so far unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880210;New Evidence Worsens Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880210;Investigation of the current party scandal by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ press has brought to light a number of interesting facts. It seems that abuse of power and influence goes well beyond what was initially revealed. Only the surface of this affair has been touched so far, and God only knows what might turn up within the next few weeks. No-one in $COUNTRY$ appears to be discussing anything else at the moment, and already there are calls in the press for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to step down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999000;National Debate: Trade Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999000;Let the debate take its own course, and let the chips fall where they may!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999002;National Debate: Religious Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999002;'The morality and virtue of our people have started to decline!' This statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality. They have started to question the country's view on religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999002;There are no Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999002;Religion is not a political issue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTD999002;There is one faith and one faith only!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999003;National Debate: Citizenship Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two. One wish that immigrants should adapt to the dominant culture while the other believes that they should retain their cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999003;Give them residency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999003;We need to limit their citizenship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999004;National Debate: War Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999004;Patriots and pacifists are fighting in the townhouse, using words to hurt and kill their enemies. A long since dead and buried dispute between $COUNTRY$ and its neighbor has once again shown its ugly head. Patriots wish to invade the country while pacifists believe that there are other ways to resolve the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999004;We are patriots and we are going to fight for our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999004;Violence can be used, but in this situation it would be meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTD999004;This can be solved without violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999010;The Political Campaign Of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999010;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political parties have begun a nationwide election campaign. So far, the effects have been quite limited, but in the end, one party will gain the upper hand. Advisors state that we could try to influence the outcome ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999020;Calm Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999020;The remaining election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually quiet. The political parties have had no pressing issues which have gripped the country's attention,  and the election seems to be passing without any national debates or events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999020;There shall be peace and quite in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999021;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999021;The election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually violent. Only a few days after the campaign had begun, the first incidents started. Strikes occured in several large factories, with incidents of streetfighting in most major cities. Paramilitary groups have threatened voters of opposing ideologies, while radicals have staged attacks on political enemies. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police are tirelessly to get the situation under control, but it looks as if $COUNTRY$ is in for a contentious election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999021;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999022;Riots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999022;The tensions from the current election campaign have escalated, with disorder spreading fast in $CAPITAL$ and spreading elsewhere. Advisors are recommending that the military be brought into the capital to restore order, though doing so will only contain the violence at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999022;Send in the army. Order must be restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999035;The Social Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999035;A new breed of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberals has become very active in the current election-- educated liberals who believe equally in both social and political reform.

EVTNAME999036;Reactionary Surge;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999036;There are a large number of people, particularly among the ruling elite of $COUNTRY$, who believe that liberal attitudes have been responsible for all of the country's ills. They advocate controls on immigration and a repeal of voting rights. They also appear to have charismatic speakers, for they seem to be gathering a lot of attention in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999037;Surge of Conservatism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999037;It looks like the conservatives have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999040;National Debate: Voting Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999040;'Why should only the rich be allowed to vote? We also pay taxes, so why shouldn't we have something to say in politics?' \n\nThe industrial revolution has empowered the middle class. More and more businessmen are making more and more money. It seems only natural that they demand voting rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999040;They are right - support their reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999040;Voting rights for the middle class? Nay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC999040;A reform is long past due - issue a new voting right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999041;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999041;'...and mind you, we even pay way higher taxes then they do! Still, their votes are worth more than ours - I ask you: is that really fair?' \n\nWhile being allowed to vote, the middle class feels diminished by the current weighted voting rights, and the subject has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999041;Sounds like a good idea, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999041;Stop these ungrateful wretches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC999041;We shall do this right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999042;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999042;'Why is everyone trying to keep us out of politics? Because we are uneducated? They call us minors, but that is a lie! Our sweet and toil has brought the nation forward! We have waited long enough - now we demand our just due!' \n\nThe subject of voting rights for the poor has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999042;Better late then never.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999042;Better never than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC999042;Better now than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999043;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999043;'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed' \n - Thomas Jefferson;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTOPTA999043;A rightful initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTC999043;Equal votes for equal chances - NOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999044;Right In The Face;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999044;'They have beaten me, again and again. Why? Because I am a proud citizen who will speak the truth! I don't believe that the ruling party will save us. And my weapon is logic, but theirs is the stick.'\n\nThe issue of political party harassment has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999044;This has to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999044;There is no need to change the system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999045;Election Fraud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999045;'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD! That's what it is, I tell you!'\n\nThe issue of voter district gerrymandering has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999045;You are right, we have to do something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999045;Want me to play the world's smallest violin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999046;Request For Privacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999046;'Why does everyone stare at me when I make my vote? Do they really need to know? It is not like I am committing a crime or something, I simply want to vote in peace. Without having half of the polling station looking at me, that is.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999046;I guess some privacy would be in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999046;What's next? Blindfolds?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999049;National Debate: Unemployment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999049;The election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999049;The liberals are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999049;The socialists are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC999049;Do not get involved in the debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999050;Unemployment Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999050;Unemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed. During the election of $YEAR$, communists and fascists argued that their dogma is the only one that will give work to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999050;Communism is our only hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999050;Fascism is our only hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTD999049;Do not get involved in the debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999055;The Child Labor Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all labourers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999056;The Rights of Minorities;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999057;The Immigration Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999060;War Dominates the Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999061;Talk of War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbours, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME999065;The Slavery Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160001;Anarchy in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160001;We are receiving disturbing reports of anarchy in southern China. A peasant army led by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui has declared the ascendance of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' and driven out local governors. All within the Qin government agree that we cannot recognize these rebels as having credence-- if we do, it raises the question of whether the Mandate of Heaven is still held by the Imperial throne. That cannot be allowed, and thus the governors must be given the opportunity to crush the rebels and restore order in the Emperor's name.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1600010;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1600010;It is as we feared-- the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has assumed control of lands in the south, and any attempts by the local governors to resume authority have failed. It is an embarassment to the prestige of the Imperial throne that we must deign to recognize that these rebels exist and must be dealt with once and for all. Some are even beginning to question the Mandate of Heaven if such a threat is possible. If we do not act, however, the rebels will surely gain control over not only the south but perhaps all of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1605020;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1605020;After a period of self-enforced isolation, Hong Xiuquan has died-- some say of poison, others of illness. Regardless of the cause, the nation has been thrown into mourning for their beloved leader. Hong Xiuquan's son, Hong Tianguifu, is ready to step into his father's role as leader, but there are some who fear he will be unsuitable. They are advocating a restoration of the Qin dynasty. Others say that $COUNTRY$ must become a republic, in emulation of western powers. Whether $COUNTRY$ is ready for such a change is difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME11380019;Constitutional Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11380019;In a surprise election win, the fascists have taken power in the government. Technically they are allowed to do so, and their party has not been banned. There are concerns, however, that their ultimate goal is to take over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and that this election win is just the first step in doing so. Some are even suggesting the possibility of voter fraud. Regardless, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have spoken... and the monarchy must decide whether to intervene and refuse the fascists their mandate as many expect. Failure to intervene means admitting that they have no power and thus relinquishing all control over the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC11380020;In a surprise election win, the communists have taken power in the government. Technically they are allowed to do so, and their party has not been banned.

EVTDESC11380022;In a surprise election win, the communists have taken power in the government-- despite the fact that their party opposes the monarchy and has been banned. Regardless, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have spoken, and thus a political showdown has resulted: the communists cannot be permitted to win, but even if they're refused the next election might simply have the same crisis occur all over again. Perhaps the time has come to reconsider electoral reforms and put the power back where it belongs?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTNAME152009872;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009872;There is unrest among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officers in the military, enough that some of them are actively spreading dissension among the ranks. $COUNTRY$ would be better served, they say, if the army was in charge rather than the current leadership-- elected it may be, but according to them it has proven too ineffective. And it seems many of the men under their command agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME152009873;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Military Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009873;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ army forces in $CAPITAL$ have made their way toward the government buildings-- not to protect the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as is their duty, but instead to oust our leaders and install themselves as $COUNTRY$'s new rulers. They claim that $COUNTRY$ is in a state of 'upheaval', and only the army can restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME16050214;Retreat to Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16050214;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Taiwan. The suggestion among what little remains of the Kuomintang government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taipei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.  We shall however never relinquish our rightful claim to the mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME16050215;Victory over the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16050215;With their armies deafeated, their provinces occupied and their government retreating to Taiwan it has become clear that the Kuomintang no longer has the will to fight.  We may now claim dominance over China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
