bohemian_zadar_title;The Zadar Proposal;x
bohemian_zadar_desc;Bohemia is one of the most powerful and industrialised countries in the world, yet we are landlocked and dependent on our neighbours to conduct international trade. We should change this. Having a warm relationship as we do, perhaps we could propose that Croatia lease us that port in Zadar, and we will, in return, fund railroads which both we and they can use, as well as giving them a sum of money.

call_brunswick_congress2_title;Call the Brunswick Congress of Germans;x
call_brunswick_congress2_desc;Agitation among the inhabitants of the various states of the old Holy Roman Empire has been increasing recently. Calls for German unification and a rising sense of kinship that transcends political borders has caused some unrest among the people because of the rivalries of the princes. We should call delegates from around the north to discuss the situation. External threats are another concern that will weigh heavily on delegates' minds and we will likely see many states banding together politically.;x

claim_balearics_title;Claim the Balearic Islands;x
claim_balearics_desc;The Balearic Islands of Mallorca and Menorca have long held an important position in the trading of the western end of the Mediterranean, and acquiring them would bolster our reputation and ability to control and conduct trade in that region.

claim_bar_lorraine_title;Claim Bar and Lorraine;x
claim_bar_lorraine_desc;The French crown's ownership of Bar and Lorraine can be traced back to the time of Charlemagne. The two duchies were part of the Holy Roman Empire, but, being on its periphery, never were an integral part, and remained neutral in the Imperial War.

You have until then to prepare for war to take the throne.;x
claim_rose_title;Claim Rosè;x
claim_rose_desc;Daufinat has chosen to join the Padan Union, but this is primarily because of the Cisalpine inhabitants of the Piemont.

claim_zeeland_title;Claim Zeeland;x
claim_zeeland_desc;Being a great and powerful nation, others will surely not deny that we are the rightful owners of Zeeland. Indeed, some of the towns and cities of the region expressed interest in joining our kingdom when we united in 1814.

colonise_jukuna_title;Colonise Jukuna;x
colonise_jukuna_desc;The lands that the natives call Jukuna are, quite frankly, inhospitable. But with the gold and other riches we found in Iggatlan, there may be more further north!

embrace_irish_desc;With control over Éirland now established, we should look toward integrating them into our own culture, allowing them some say in our government and welcome among our own people.;x
embrace_maltese_title;Embrace the Maltese;x
embrace_maltese_desc;The Maltese people are few and confined to their islands, but they are a proud race with a long history. They should be made to feel welcome and to be equal in our society if we are to truly be a republic.;x
embrace_maretans_title;Embrace the Maretans;x
embrace_maretans_desc;The Marenan people are few and confined to their islands, but they are a proud race with a long history of self-reliance and self-sufficience. They have put that aside now to seek prosperity in partnership with us. Thus, they should be made to feel welcome and equal in our society, for the good of all.;x
embrace_nanfaren_title;Accept Nanfanren;x
embrace_nanfaren_desc;The Southerners speak languages that sound different than ours, and they prefer rice over noodles, but we are all Chinese.;x
embrace_portuguese_title;Embrace Portuguese;x
embrace_portuguese_desc;The Portuguese speak a language that is noticeably distinct from Spanish and will resent our rule at first. However, by allowing some regional autonomy and making a sincere effort to respect their culture, we might forge a new era of cooperation between the Spanish and Portuguese people.;x
embrace_romansh_title;Protect Romansh People;x
embrace_romansh_desc;The Romansh people are a small minority we inherited after annexing Helvetia. Too few to have their own country, members of local Romansh communities have petitioned our government for official protection, as was the case under the Helvetian government. They cite their strong ethnic and cultural ties to Germany - despite their strange language -, as well as their past services to Helvetia, which they would gladly pass to us as their new rulers should we allow them the same rights as proper Germans. Offering protection to such a petty minority might demean a country as great as ours, but would be looked up favorably in the eyes of foreign moralists, as well as helping to restore a sense of normalcy to the former Helvetian cantons.;x
embrace_sicilians_title;Embrace the Sicilians;x
embrace_sicilians_desc;The Sicilian people are hardworking and numerous. They have elected now to seek prosperity in partnership with us. They should have ever right and privilege extended to them as to our Greek-speaking citizens, for the good of all.;x
embrace_little_russians_title;Embrace the Little Russians;x
embrace_little_russians_desc;They may speak strange versions of the language of the Great Russians, but they can still be useful to the empire. Let us accept these people with open arms.;x
embrace_slovaks_title;Embrace the Slovaks;x
embrace_slovaks_desc;The Slovaks have long lived peacefully under our rule. Almost identical in language and culture, their separate identity stems more from geography than anything else. By calling them equals and allowing them use of their language in Slovakia proper, we will earn their adoration and simultaneously make governance easier.;x
emden_accords_title;Propose a Solution to Emden;x
emden_accords_desc;With the further unifications of the Germans of the north, they now have real cause and real strength to reclaim Emden, which we refused to give to Brunswick. In advance of tensions that will inevitably arise from the situation of our ownership, we should propose some solution. Let us approach the Germans and negotiate.;x
encourage_tatar_revolts_title;Sow Dissent Among the Smolenskii Tatars;x
encourage_tatar_revolts_desc;Spread rumours and support dissident Tatars, and we may manage to destabilize our enemy's realm and make it easier to destroy them.;x
end_smolensk_title;Put an End to Smolensk;x
end_smolensk_desc;Now that all the lands of Smolensk are lost to them, it is time to "convince" the Korol of Smolensk and his family to abandon all claims to the former kingdom and thus allow the Tsar to have uncontested control of their lands. Note to the player: Don't go abusing this now, just take it immediately. The MIL and CON reduction exists to try to make any lingering Russian Unification rebels go away.;x
end_the_nobility_title;End the Nobility;x
end_the_nobility_desc;Now that the rebellious dukes of Champagne, Orléans, and Normandy have been put down, we should remove their power and any chance that they could threaten France again! They shall be nobility in their memories only!;x
enlist_tatars_title;The Kazan Pact - Kazanskii Dogovor;x
enlist_tatars_desc;The more populous crown of Smolensk, which falsely claims to be heir to Russia, has many more soldiers than do we. There is, however, opportunity. The Tatars, the once-feared horselords of the steppe, are divided subjects of both countries. If we curry favour with them, we may be able to destabilize Smolensk, allowing us to defeat them. By accepting the Kazani Tatars as equals, we may gain an important advantage with all of the inhabitants of the steppe. However, stories of their cruelty remain and the other peoples of our empire may not be so happy.;x
establish_la_guardia_civil_title;El Cuerpo Nacional de Carabineros;x
establish_la_guardia_civil_desc;’El Cuerpo Nacional de Carabineros', Spanish for 'The National Carabiniers', is the Hispanian gendarmerie corps, established during the reign of Lope II in the aftermath of the bloody Años Rojos. Although foreign intervention crushed the Revolution and restored the Monarchy, Albesan sympathies lingered in the countryside and some cities, with some areas never fully pacified. It is in this context that the Carabiniers were born, a mixed police-military force with far-reaching powers to pacify the restive populace and maintain the monarchical order.;x
expand_BHN_title;Claim Hungary's Historical Borders;x
expand_BHN_desc;The crown of Hungary once encompassed a much wider area than it does today. We can expand our territory and further earn the loyalty of the Hungarians by helping them reclaim their historical greatness.;x
expand_halesca_title;Expand Halesca;x
expand_halesca_desc;Given Skamisc and other countries' ambitions in North Ameriga, it seems prudent to claim the land all the way to the Skamisc border at the 141st parallel. That way, none can try to sneak around us, and we can exploit the resources to be found in our rich, if far-flung, colony.;x
expand_to_jordrac_title;Expand to the Jordrac;x
expand_to_jordrac_desc;The massive Jordrac River to our south is a perfect natural border for Gidan. Uilscyr has a weak claim to the lands north of the river, which are populated by native peoples with few Uislc settlers. Let us claim this vast expanse of the rainforest for ourselves!;x 
expand_to_kilikia_title;Expand to Kilikia;x
expand_to_kilikia_desc;With the war over and peace restored, we can once again look outward. The Muslims in Armenia are weak and hold territory that was once Roman. Let us reclaim it and cut them off from the Mediterranean, thus weakening them further.;x
expedition_to_okhotsk_title;Mount the Svetaev Expedition;x
expedition_to_okhotsk_desc;In 1845, Count Bogdan Svetayev was commissioned by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to explore and lay claim to lands at the western coast of Asia beyond the recently conquered lands of the Yakuts. Svetayev and his men mapped out the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk from the border of Manchurian-claimed land to the Bay of Ayan, claiming it in the name of $COUNTRY$.;x

force_cw_gxi_desc;Our nation lies at the crossroads of Southeast Asia and China, influenced by both yet belonging fully to neither. We must firmly choose which direction our future lies in. \n\n§RTaking this decision means going to war with the Qin!;x
force_cw_qin_title;The Future of Nanyue;x
force_cw_qin_desc;Nanyue is a remnant of the Ming collapse and has long escaped our attention. It is time to make them decide once and for all where their King's allegiance lies.;x
form_greater_netherlands_title;Form the Greater Netherlands;x
form_greater_netherlands_desc;Our superiority over Brabant and Wallonia and our elevated position in the world are undisputed. We can use our power to gain political and domestic control over Brabant and Wallonia, and thus form a greater Empire than has been seen in our region for almost a millennium!;x
form_mellomamerika_title;Form Mellomamerika;x
form_mellomamerika_desc;Our superiority over our other Mellomsk neighbors puts us in a position to form a powerful union of Mellomamerika. Let us embrace our destiny!;x
form_mellomamerika_without_title;Unify Mellomamerika;x
form_mellomamerika_without_desc;The small Mellomsk settler states of Mellomamerika, long abandoned by their former Norwegian colonial overloards, would be a far more useful ally if united - under our guidance, of course.;x
form_meridion_title;Unite the South;x
form_meridion_desc;It is time to formally incorporate Rome and Sicily into our kingdom, and with that a better name is needed. The Meridion is the whole southern part of the Italian peninsula - it has been so called in the vernacular throughout Europe for centuries. Let it now enter the formal, too. The Meridion shall be our stepping stone to bringing the whole of the Italian peninsula under our sway!;x
form_irakleio_title;Declare the Republic of Irakleio;x
form_irakleio_desc;The fortunes of our island trade republic continue to rise, and it is necessary that we no longer be confined to an old name and an old way of thinking. We must restructure our country to better ensure our continued survival and prosperity. Let us rebrand ourselves as the Republic of Irakleio, a truly cosmopolitan country where prosperity, not ethnicity or language, is the deciding factor in a man's worth.;x
form_italy_title;Avanti Italia!;x
form_italy_desc;By establishing a dominant position on the Italian peninsula, we can create a national homeland for all its residents by proclaiming ourselves the motive power of a unified Italian state. Such a thing has never before been done, but the Italians have never been conventional people. \n\n§RNB: In addition to Italian cores you must control/puppet Florence, Genoa, Milan and Venice.;x
form_russian_empire_title;Declare a Great Russian Empire;x
form_russian_empire_desc;With the final defeat of the backwards, religion-obsessed Tsar in Moscow, it is time to unite all Great Russians in a more Westward-facing empire, under the Imperator in Smolensk, the true capital of all Russia!;x
form_scylfiga_woning_title;An Amerigan Woning;x
form_scylfiga_woning_desc; Against all odds, Aenglisc settlers once carved out homes in the wilderness of western Ameriga. Now we must bring their descendants together under one flag.;x
form_stellaland_title;Form Stellaland;x
form_stellaland_desc;With the lands of the Steenkoolers united under our banner, we can seek a greater destiny for everyone under the four stars of our people. Let us never bow to Europeans or Africans.;x
form_zachadia_title;Form Zachadia;x
form_zachadia_desc;Philologists have confirmed what we have already long known: that the Poles, Czechs, Silesians, and Slovaks all speak closely related languages, which have come to be called the Western Slavic family. Given our cultural, linguistic, and geographical proximity, we could unite our peoples into a great nation.\n\nNOTE! Western Slavs must control Silesian and Polish cores (Slovakia can be owned by them, or Hungary can be puppeted), and Prague/Bohemia must be sphered and puppeted with +100 relations. If a non-Western Slavic country owns Silesian or Polish cores, the decision cannot be taken, no matter what.;x
FRA_embrace_bretons_title;Integrate the Bretons;x
FRA_embrace_bretons_desc;The Bretons will continue to be troublesome and agitate for independence unless something is done to appease them. By granting them the same rights that proper French citizens have, perhaps we may succeed in appeasing them and reducing their unruliness and restlessness.;x
FRA_embrace_picards_title;Embrace the Picards;x
FRA_embrace_picards_desc;While they may speak a strange variant of our own language, we must look to the Picards as cousins, at least. Let us show them that they will do just as well under the French umbrella as under the Wallonian one, even if it leaves a bad taste in our mouth to make such a concession to them.;x
FRA_embrace_walloons_title;Walloon Societal Integration;x
FRA_embrace_walloons_desc;The Walloons will be restive for generations unless we grant them some place in our society. We will grant them concessions if only so that their rich lands will be more productive for us than they currently are.;x
FRA_levant_ultimatum_title;The Outremer Question;x
FRA_levant_ultimatum_desc;The Outremer people of the Levant, descendents of French crusaders from the Middle Ages, have long languished under the Persian yoke. With a now-unified and strong France, and unrest in the Levant rising to a fever pitch, it is our moral imperative to unite with our long-sundered brethren. Repeated intransigence by the Shah's government leaves us no choice - they must accept our ultimatum or face our wrath.;x
FRA_levant_war_title;War in the Levant;x
FRA_levant_war_desc;With the Shah having arrogantly dismissed our just demands, now only one recourse remains - war! We will conquer the Levant, as our predecessors did 800 years ago.;x
FRA_rename_levant_title;Rename the Levantine Provinces;x
FRA_rename_levant_desc;Now that we have established firm control over the Outremer provinces, it is time to show the world that we are their rightful owners by returning the major settlements to their original French names.;x
FRA_return_our_colonies_title;The Return of the Iles Bleus;x
FRA_return_our_colonies_desc;Now that we once again have access to the sea and a proper navy, we can start reclaiming our former colonies. Let's start with our colony in the Iles Bleus, which is administered by Brittany at the moment.;x
further_the_revolution_in_DAU_title;Further the Revolution in Daufinat;x
further_the_revolution_in_DAU_desc;The monarchists of our cousins in Daufinat are facing serious opposition from their own liberal people, who seek to set up a democracy similar to ours. By sending a diplomatic mission, we may be able to convince the Duke, Guigues de Mauguio, to give up rather than lose his life fighting for a lost cause.;x
garda_civica_title;Form the Garda Civica;x
garda_civica_desc;In revolutionary Aquitània, giving the people more say in the maintenance of order was a top priority in securing and legitimising the new, post-royal government. Thus, as a means of restoring order and prosperity to the country, the Garda Civica was formed. Composed of volunteer citizens of both sexes, the GC was meant to bring peace.;x

greek_macedonia_arbenon_title;Claim Macedonia and Arbenon;x
greek_macedonia_arbenon_desc;Now that we have proven our strength to the failing Empire and to the world, it is time to expand our democracy to the north, to the ancient Greek lands before the Empire established its rule over us all those long centuries ago. The myriad peoples in these lands have much in common historically and culturally with ours, even if their languages may now be different. Let us incorporate them into our revolutionary democracy!;x
greek_salonika_title;Claim Salonika;x
greek_salonika_desc;One of the most important cities in the whole region, the people of Salonika did not choose to join our great democratic experiment. Now that experiment has proven to be stable. Let us claim the rest of Thessalonikos for Greece!;x
greek_sevastopol_title;Restoration of Cherson;x
greek_sevastopole_desc;Now that we have reclaimed the ancient theme of Cherson, it is time to restore its old names and invite the Roman diaspora around the sea to settle in the land of their ancestors.;x
gxi_china_expanse_title;Claim Southern China;x
gxi_china_expanse_desc;We have proven our military and cultural power in Asia while the Qin languish in backwardness and stagnate. We should seize the border provinces and liberate their impoverished masses from servitude to an Emperor who has no power.;x

headwaters_po_title;The Headwaters of the Pò;x
headwaters_po_desc;Ours is a country of the Padanian plain. The P? River is ever in our minds, yet its source lies not in our lands. Its peoples are much more like to use than to anyone else. So let us lay claim to the whole of the P? valley, even up to its headwaters in the Pian del Re. Avànti, Padanesi!;x
hegemony_gidan_title;Establish Hegemony over Gidan;x
hegemony_gidan_desc;The people of Gidan speak our language and share many aspects of our culture. While historically, we were separated by the vast wildernesses of the northern bank of the Jordrac River, the advance of progress allows us to bring them under our wing for the good of all.;x
helvetian_patrimony_title;The Helvetian Patrimony;x
helvetian_patrimony_desc;The Germans of the South are united under one flag. Almost united. The cantons of Helvetia, long isolated by choice from Germany proper, must be brought into the fold. It will not be by their decision that the destiny of Germany left to rot by the side of the road to glory. They must join us, for the good of all Germans.;x
hispania_by_sword_title;Begin the Reconquista;x
hispania_by_sword_desc;Hispania was always one of the dominant powers in western Europe, but in 1829, the League of the Ten Monarchs violently and unjustly stripped away many of our core lands to limit our power even as they restored us to our rightful place on the throne. By declaring a Reconquista of all Iberia, we will announce our objective to take back what was once ours. Hispania will rise again, and may the consequences damn whoever stands in our way!;x
honour_vikings_title;Honour the Vikings;x
honour_vikings_desc;An awareness of the great past of our people is growing thanks to an increasing interest in archaeology and history. The people of $COUNTRY$ were once fierce warriors, feared throughout Europe, little more than 600 years ago, and they had a lasting impact on the world. Let us honour their enterprising spirit!;x
host_munich_conference_title;Call the Munich Conference;x
host_munich_conference_desc;With the unification of the northern states into just two major powers, both of whom are strong enough to challenge Bavaria, it is time that we, too, unify with our brethren, Baden and Wurttemburg. We will call this conference and coerce their heads of state into joining us, for the good of us all and all Germany.;x

hta_no_sml_sphere_desc;No country should sphere Smolensk because it will mess things up.;x
HtA_POL_setup_title;Poland Setup;x
HtA_POL_setup_desc;Poland is ruled not only by the king, but also by the Sejm - a legislative chamber composed of nobles of the realm who vote by majority rule. This body has met semi-annually for six weeks since time immemorial. A democratic body, it stands in stark opposition to the more absolutist methods of rule Poland's neighbours employ. The involvement of nobility tends to guarantee their investment in the well-being of the state, and this has effects beyond the legislation the body produces: each member ensures that the land he owns is as prosperous as can be.;x
incite_byelorussians_title;Incite Byelorussians;x
incite_byelorussians_desc;If we are to continue to weaken our rival in Smolensk, then it will not be on the field of battle, but in the hearts and minds of the downtrodden minorities of their empire. We will stir up local grievances in order to sow chaos in their country.;x
incite_ukrainians_title;Incite Ukrainians;x
incite_ukrainians_desc;The Ukrainians have long had a separate identity from the Great Russians, even those of Smolensk. Their culture and language are similar, but their history of fraternization with the Cossacks has institutionalized distrust against them by the ruling elites of the country. We can inflame old tensions to strengthen the Ukrainians and to cause further headaches for Smolensk.;x
incorporate_brabant_title;Incorporate Brabant into the Netherlands;x
incorporate_brabant_desc;Now that we've claimed Zeeland, why not just get the rest of the Duchy of Brabant, too? After all, its inhabitants are all Dutch speakers, even if they have a strange dialect. Incorporating the Flemish of Brabant is a natural step in continuing to ensure our greatness.;x
info_AEN_title;HtA Aengland Info;x
info_AEN_desc;First of all, if you care, check out the Aenglisc pronunciation guide for a sense of how the language should be pronounced. When you get cores on Alba's homelands, you'll get events to get some of their colonies, and other nearby colonial powers will be able to seize some, too. As shown in Spudgun's HtA series, this can cause frustration for the Alba player, as there's no real way for them NOT to lose all their land if you go and take their cores.;x
info_BYZ_title;HtA Roman Empire Info;x
info_BYZ_desc;You start big and have lots of potential to get properly powerful. Info about the Roman Civil War: it will be foreshadowed in the 1840s and 50s and then Anatole and Greece will be released as your vassals around 1858-62. I highly suggest that you don't do silly things like canceling their vassal status and then annexing them, mostly because a) that's not how I test it and you're going to mess up flags and stuff and b) that's lame.\n\nAfter the Civil War you'll get decisions to expand further east and to get back into Italy. The time between reclaiming your cores from Armenia and the civil war is about rebuilding and modernizing.;x
info_german_title;HtA Germany Info;x
info_german_desc;The big three in Germany are of course the big B's - Bavaria, Brandenburg and Brunswick (who at the beginning of the game is big on soft power). Once it's time to claim German hegemony (which currently can only be done with those three), you'll take the decision and the others should immediately follow. Then there'll be a major event which will announce the beginning of the wars. Only after that are the CBs available. NB - If you from NGF or SGF, you will lose access to these CBs. I'll rework Germany formation in 0.40 probably and remove NGF/SGF.;x
info_MLT_title;HtA Malta Info;x
info_MLT_desc;I recommend against playing Malta. It's going to be even more lame than in vanilla, because while there's a little bit of flavour, I didn't really bother to write events for much of the Maltese side of things, and if you're playing railroaded, you're GOING to get puppeted and annexed. So just don't.;x
info_NPL_title;HtA Southern Italy Info;x
info_NPL_desc;In this game, Italy is a geographical term and it will take some BIG work to get to control all of Italy as we know it in our world. First things first, you'll want to form Meridion, a formable which formally incorporates Sicily (not a centralized part of the Kingdom of Naples) and the Papal States. After that you'll have to see what kinds of opportunities arise for targeting the Padan Union, and then form Italy. (As of the end of 2021, there's nothing yet that will let you do anything that conquer them with your own initiative.);x
info_PDN_title;HtA Padan Union Info;x
info_PDN_desc;If you didn't already know, within a couple of years of game start, these four countries under the Alps will unite. It will work as any of them, but don't have an MP with more than one person playing among the four countries.\n\nIt's also not a great idea to have a human Padan Union and a human Naples if you want them to cooperate, due to the way some things are written.;x
info_POL_title;HtA Poland Info;x
info_POL_desc;There is still work to be done on Poland with regard to the Sejm, coming up on 0.37. You may see that you have a bunch of negative modifiers. These are intended to represent the feudal and Sejm systems. Obviously you can get rid of them with the relevant decisions if you want.\n\nDon't sphere Smolensk because you'll mess up the story that's going on there with Russia, as Poland is intended to be antagonistic toward Smolensk. You'll get a chance to get some land from them with the Treaty of Brest decision.;x
info_RUS_title;HtA Russia Info;x
info_RUS_desc;War with Smolensk will come later. You can't fight them right away. Focus on building up your military and getting through the decision chains to sow discontent in their territory, and get allies. Go as far east as possible with colonization. Only after you've taken the decision to incite Ukrainians will the CB to fight the Russian Hegemony war become available for both countries (or if it's after 1850). Railroaded Smolensk can't use it, though, because the AI is dumb. As long as you win one war with that CB (take any state), you will cause an event which will give them tons of militancy. If Russian Unification rebels don't pop up eventually and overthrow them, you can just fight another war to annex them with the Russian Unification CB. You'll eventually get an event to annex Vitebsk. After you get Nationalism and Imperialism, you can consider sphereing the four central Asian countries and then wait for an event to fire which will annex them, or you could just go to war. There's a decision which will allow you to sphere Kazakh after 1854, so you don't HAVE to sphere them with any urgency.;x
info_SCO_title;HtA Alba Info;x
info_SCO_desc;Just a warning - If Aengland starts messing you up badly, and they take one of your starting states, you're going to lose your colonies to other nearby countries. So don't count on retreating there. The justification for this is that with the loss of the homelands, you have no real means of maintaining your presence in the face of those who would like to take them away from you. Plus, the AI is dumb and I wanted to ensure that they would be able to manage all of this more easily.;x
info_SML_title;HtA Smolensk Info;x
info_SML_desc;Important: If you play railroaded, get ready for a very unfair and probably confusing run. Now that that's out of the way, you start in a very strong position to overwhelm Russia (indeed, it should be easy!), but you'll have to be patient. You'll be able to use the special casus belli later after certain conditions are met - namely the Russians have to have taken a decision to incite your Ukrainian POPs (or if it's after 1850). The reason for not being able attack right away is that the populace of Smolensk, being highly religious, would never (initially) support a war against Russia (which has the backing of the church, among other things). Anyways, you'll get that CB. Take one state. After winning the war and getting the event The Russian Tsardom Chastened, you'll have an annexation-type CB instead. Russia may fall to rebels or you may have to make them fall to you after the truce. You'll be able to reform Russia as a more secularized, western-looking Empire after the annexation. After you beat Russia and get Nationalism and Imperialism, you can consider sphereing the four central Asian countries and then wait for an event to fire which will annex them, or you could just go to war.;x
inland_claims_title;Our Inland Claims;x
inland_claims_desc;Uilscyr has been making plans to go up and claim the far reaches of the tributaries of the Jordrac River. This would bring them uncomfortably close to our territory. We should beat them to the punch, and maybe we'll discover some useful and interesting things in these lands.;x
install_miravelli_governor_title;Install a Miravelli Governor in Florence;x
install_miravelli_governor_desc;As Tuscany has continued to be restive in the decades since its conquest - in spite of continued efforts both violent and peaceful to convince the people to accept our rule - it is time to make a concession that will end the troubles once and for all. A Miravelli will be restored to power in Florence, but under our terms and control. Federico Miravelli is a nephew of the late Grand Duke Giancarlo, and has promised to do his utmost to cooperate with us, for the sake of his people. We are assured that this will placate the Tuscan people enough so that they will cease to be such a drain on our finances and military.;x
integrate_cymru_title;Integrate Cymru;x
integrate_cymru_desc;It was only in 1829 that the Duke of Cymru, Owain of Aberdaugleddau, made his realm subservient to ours, in a moment of diplomatic clarity. However, recent events between our two countries and a changing diplomatic situation abroad necessitate that we establish direct control over the Cymraeg lands. Perhaps the Duke can be made to see reason, but if not, then use of force must be considered.;x
integrate_native_states_title;Integrate all Indigenous People;x
integrate_native_states_desc;Aztlan's native people are the primogenitors of this land and have a right to it. We will accomodate all who belong here, under one government, of course.;x
integrate_navarra_title;Integrate Navarra;x
integrate_navarra_desc;Personal unions and vassal states are an antiquated concept more befitting of the 17th century than the 19th. Let us work to make Navarra a truly intrinsic part of the Hispanian Empire.;x

look_for_a_buyer_for_aqt_s_a_desc;In light of the recent banning of slavery in Aquitània, the value of our plantations in our South Amerigan colony of Araguari has crashed. We should consider selling the land - the intendencies of Nova Bordeu and Porterei to Gidan or Uilscyr.

megalux_title;Form Megalux;x
megalux_desc;The tiny Grand Duchy of $COUNTRYNAME$ has been ignored, for good or for ill, for centuries. But it has always dreamed of greatness. The only thing it has ever been known for was its cosmopolitanism, and that will be the source of its greatest strength now. The whole world will come to bow before Megalux master of France, Germany, and Wallonia!\n\n§RNote that if you choose to join Brunswick or Brandenburg during the Brunswick Congress, you'll get a slightly different decision which doesn't give Central German as an accepted culture (because there are other ways to that). Also, there's no point in trying to do both this one and the one when you join with one of the Germans.;x
megalux_dutch_title;The Lands of the Dutch;x

mrg_civil_rights_title;Civil Rights in Margaria;x
mrg_civil_rights_desc;The end of slavery leaves us with a large population of former slaves who remain impoverished and often are still subject to the whims of their former masters.

negotiate_with_aengland_title;Negotiate a treaty with Aengland;x
negotiate_with_aengland_desc;The situation along the border with Aengland is untenable. They have recovered from the past century of troubles and sport a stronger military than our own.

Why not defuse the tension by offering to give it back to them in exchange for Ellan Mannin and an alliance against the other threat we face, Éire?;x

new_life_in_the_new_world_desc;With the large political freedom that's enjoyed in our country, there's a new proposal in the upper house to boost our numbers: large numbers of Europeans can be brought to our country to work in the fields, their travel being paid by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.

norwegian_caribbean_title;Issue the Declaration of Kajahikos;x
norwegian_caribbean_desc;For a great many years the king in Anslo had been forced to accept the sovereignty of various elected legislative bodies due to the strictures of the Constitution of 1822, which was ultimately accepted by the royal family under duress. However, the alignment of many of those legislative bodies with the destabilizing forces of Albesanism and the subsequent royal coup, which saw members of the royal family and the solidly absolutist army and navy dissolve the liberal constitution, have rendered the king a free hand in Norway. With support for the royals and Nordic nationalism both at an all-time high, and the Norwegian Navy quite large and abundantly capable of projecting force in the region, Olav Erling, the Duke of Faroe, has traveled to the Norwegian-held island of Kajahikos and, acting on orders from his elder brother King Håkon IV, proclaimed the intent of the Norwegian Crown to annex the islands of Firgene, Heymak, Curasu, and Welighefen by right of conquest. We will forge a great Atlantic empire just as the Vikings before us!;x 
norwegian_highlands_title;Claim the Albannach North;x
norwegian_highlands_desc;The north of Alba, today called Gaideldach, was a place that was settled by our peoples throughout the 11th and early 12th centuries.

Let us lay claim to it for Norge!;x
open_qin_title;Mission to the Qin Empire;x

partition_daufinat_title;Negotiate the Partition of Daufinat;x
partition_daufinat_desc;Daufinat has been a threat to Aquitània for centuries. There was indeed a time not much more than one century ago when they were more powerful than us. Times are different now, and with the new Duke having inherited Aymon de Buonavi's throne being a less than competent leader, we have an opportunity to expand our holdings to the Alps and improve relations with the Padan Union. We can negotiate a deal to partition Daufinat among ourselves, which will improve the strategic and international standing of both of our countries! \n§RNote: Immediate war is possible.;x

PER_bushire_treaty_port_title;The Port of Bushire;x

PER_levant_victory_title;Victory in the Levant;x
PER_levant_victory_desc;The Persian armies have braved great trials in our war against the warmongering westerners who came seeking to carve our Levantine possessions up for themselves, achieving a victory that many even in Persia did not consider to be possible.

We shall exile them to the mountainous interior of our country.;x
PER_qeshm_treaty_port_title;The Port of Qeshm;x
PER_qeshm_treaty_port_desc;The island of Qeshm, due to its strategic position in the middle of the Strait of Hormuz, has historically been a major trade node in the routes between India and the West.

PER_reyshahr_treaty_port_desc;Reyshahr is located near the delta of the great Mesopotamian rivers.

protect_cherokee_desc;Our peoples have long been pressed on all sides by the white man. We have stood as protectors of the Cherokee for some two centuries now, and have always embraced them as brothers while still helping them to live freely.

renew_zadar_lease_title;Renew the Lease on Zadar;x
renew_zadar_lease_desc;It has been some time since our troubles with the Hungarians and consequent loss of Zadar. But now, a new $COUNTRY$ has risen, and we seek salt and sun of the Mediterranean once more! Let us ask our neighbour to the south about the possibility of leasing it again.;x
renovate_constantinople_title;Renovate Constantinople;x
renovate_constantinople_desc;Constantinople has stood relatively unchanged for centuries, and is a hodgepodge of different building styles and qualities. The city is constantly growing, and there have been housing and social problems. By renovating the city and building taller buildings, we can truly make Constantinople the City of World's Desire once again.;x
request_return_of_lubeck_title;Request the Return of Lübeck;x
request_return_of_lubeck_desc;The Danes have held the port city of Lübeck for centuries and insisted on their right to the surrounding area. Now that we have unified, we have heard reports of rising German nationalism in the city itself. Let us negotiate for the cession of the port with Denmark, and keep the peace.;x
restart_slave_trade_title;Restart the Atlantic Slave Trade;x
restart_slave_trade_desc;In a world where nations have renounced slavery, only Margaria firmly maintains this tradition. By acquiring colonies in Africa, we can ensure ourselves a population of slaves well into the future. However, other nations will likely view this practice as abhorrent and might declare war on us to force abolition.;x
restore_order_in_hungary_title;Restore Order in Hungary;x
restore_order_in_hungary_desc;With the rising tide of unrest and chaos in Hungary, it is time for the to monarchy make a strong response to the situation in its southern component. Let us restore order in Hungary before a full-blown rebellion breaks loose!;x
restore_yuc_title;Restore Yucatla;x
restore_yuc_desc;The Mayan people once rebelled against our rule. Now that we have settled disputes between the natives and colonists, we should restore order to this wayward province - and make an effort to include its people this time.;x
retreat_to_hayastan_title;Retreat to Hayastan;x
retreat_to_hayastan_desc;With the loss of our lands in Asia Minor and particularly the capital of Yerzinka, it is time to fall back to the mountains of old Hayastan and dig in against any further Roman attacks. We have lost Asia Minor, but surely we will regain it some day!;x
return_croatian_land_title;Seek the Return of Croatian Land;x
return_croatian_land_desc;Per our agreement with Croatia, we should see if we can convince Austria to hand over Old Croatia peacefully, using our relationship with them. Alternatively, we could simply coerce them with strength of arms. In any case, after returning Zagreb and its surroundings to Croatia, we can finally acquire our port. Austria will probably ask for compensation.;x
return_croatia_to_croatia_title;Return Croatia its Land;x
return_croatia_to_croatia_desc;Having acquired the historical region of Old Croatia, we can now return it to the Duchy. Once we turn it over to them, they should inform us shortly that the deal to lease Zadar is finalised.;x
return_to_the_sea_title;Return to the sea!;x
return_to_the_sea_desc;Now that we have reclaimed the French heartland that was cruelly taken from us years ago we should once again lay claim to the Normand coast. Then we can truly reclaim our place in the world as a great power!;x
return_zadar_title;Return Zadar;x
return_zadar_desc;It is no longer necessary for us to lease Zadar from Croatia. It is time that the port be returned to them, with our thanks.\n\nNOTE: This is intended to be done to reduce bordergore or something. You should be able to create Yugoslavia without taking this decision.;x
return_zadar_YUG_title;Return Zadar;x
return_zadar_YUG_desc;It is no longer necessary for us to lease Zadar from Yugoslavia. It is time that the port be returned to them, with our thanks.\n\nNOTE: If you have the opportunity to take this decision, and you formed Yugoslavia, please let Savs know!;x
revive_armenian_anatolia_title;Revive Armenian Anatolia;x
revive_armenian_anatolia_desc;The dream of Armenian Anatolia, achieved once and then cruelly taken away from us, is once again in our grasp. Rich lands for our people to spread into, guaranteeing a prosperous life for all. We can reclaim our lost territory from the cursed Romans, and ensure that it will never be lost again!;x
revolt_against_smolensk_title;Revolt Against Smolensk;x
revolt_against_smolensk_desc;The Russians have promised us freedom and protection from Smolensk if we aid them in the war. Indeed, they have been spreading unreast among all the Tatars and steppe peoples, even outside our land. With the Russians, we will have greater freedom. To war!;x
revolt_against_smolensk_rr_title;Side with Russia;x
revolt_against_smolensk_rr_desc;The Russians have promised us freedom and protection from Smolensk if we aid them in the war. Indeed, they have been spreading unreast among all the Tatars and steppe peoples, even outside our land. When the time to fight comes, we will answer.;x
roman_adriatic_title;Roman Adriatic;x
roman_adriatic_desc;Now that we have reclaimed Italy, we should once more look to the Adriatic Sea. Claiming the land around the coast will be costly diplomatically, but none will prevent the Roman Eagle from spreading its wings again!;x
roman_italians_title;Embrace the Italians;x
roman_italians_desc;With the return of Italy to the Roman Empire, we can now once more accept its citizens as our own, as they were over a millennium ago. Glory to Rome!;x
roman_italy_title;Roman Italy;x
roman_italy_desc;It is time to begin reclaiming the ancient land of the Roman Empire. We should start with Italy, which has been lost to us for centuries after a brief reconquest in the 13th century. With these peoples under our wing, we can look north and reclaim the length of the peninsula.;x
russia_smolensk_bet_title;Bet on the Russia-Smolensk War;x
russia_smolensk_bet_desc;Russia's situation looks impossible, but the Duke is sure they will win in their present conflict against the Kingdom of Smolensk. Propose a wager to the Duke of Mecklenburg?;x
scaglia_decree_title;The Scaglia Decree;x
scaglia_decree_desc;From the newly appointed summer residence at Scaglia near Civitavecchia, King Giuseppe II Salenino decreed that all denizens of Tuscany and Romagna were to become $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens effective immediately, with all the rights pertaining. This was a setback to the nascent rebel movements in the regions. Their hitherto popular support took a severe blow as the weary people of the north began to give up on fighting for what many called a lost cause.;x 
secure_silesia_title;Secure Silesia from Foreign Encroachment;x
secure_silesia_desc;With its vast reserves of coal and other materials vital for fueling a country's industry, Silesia is of great interest to a number of its neighbours. Given the influence $COUNTRY$ exerts in their politics, we could arrange for a "change in leadership" that would ensure the Duchy remains loyal to $COUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$ alone.;x
secure_silesia_2_title;Political Integration of Silesia;x
secure_silesia_2_desc;It has been some time since the country of Silesia "assented" to our hegemony, but they have remained autonomous for all that time. Ours is a prosperous nation, and it would be mutually beneficial for both $COUNTRY$ and Silesia for the latter to be joined. We will now proceed to integrate Silesia into our political structure, and we may all prosper!;x
sell_alaska_title;Sell Halesca;x
sell_alaska_desc;With the loss of our colonies in the Amerigas and our current financial situation, it has become quite burdensome to maintain our colony of Halesca. In order to reach it, we have to travel extremely far, either around the Southern Cape of South Ameriga, or by shipping all the way to the East Indies. No, there are others there that may be convinced to buy it and rid us of this burden.;x
sell_dutch_natal_title;Sell the Natal;x
sell_dutch_natal_desc;Now that we have given the Oostkaap to the Germans, our colony in Natal, former Steenkooler and Zulu territory, is now somewhat isolated from the rest of the Kaap. Perhaps we should also give it to the Germans in exchange for a sum.;x
sell_solelha_title;Sell Solelha;x
sell_solelha_desc;With the abolishment of slavery, the colony of Solelha has seen profits collapse as former slaves abandon the hitherto profitable plantations. The colony has become a burden. Perhaps Margaria would be interested?;x
settle_namaqualand_title;Settle Namaqualand;x
settle_namaqualand_desc;Recent surveys in the region indicate that the Namaqualand region north of the Heeckeren River has some interesting resources, and already some of our people from the Kaap Colony have expressed interest in farming the region. Let us fund an expedition to claim and settle the region.;x
shc_war_intervene_title;Strike the Shawnee;x
shc_war_intervene_desc;The native confederation bordering us is in a desperate state. We should ensure they do not recover easily.;x
show_NPL_relations_title;Show the "Remember Our Purpose" event;x
show_NPL_relations_desc;You've previously chosen to disable getting that event - you might have noticed that it now fires in Naples. In case you missed it, it still has the same effect as the yearly event, it just doesn't give you that popup and pause your game. If you chose that and there's also a human Naples player, then the event hasn't been firing. Anyways, take this decision to see them on their normal yearly pulse again.;x

siak_protectorate_title;The Siak Protectorate;x
siak_protectorate_desc;With the Sultanate of Atjeh recently being annexed, we now have formal competition on the island of Sumatra for resources and favour. Let's use our contacts in the Sultanate of Siak to bring them closer to us, so as to limit the spread of our rivals on the island.;x
sirocco_replacement_title;The Sirocco;x
sirocco_replacement_desc;The Sirocco, the hot wind blowing from the deserts of North Africa, bathes our faces in warmth together with the sun. Today, it also brings news. It carries a call to unity and a the appeal of a common destiny with our brothers.;x

skane2_title;The Skåne Question;x
skane2_desc;Skåne is an integral part of $COUNTRY$, and for one reason or another, it is not in our domain. Let us bring this issue back to the world stage, and we will settle it.;x
stilhav_naval_base_title;Construct the Stilhav Naval Base;x
stilhav_naval_base_desc;It wasn't until the mid-1830s that the government of Høyekysten had the resources to begin asserting control over the Pacific coast. Military engineers scouted the location for the naval base in 1833, but it wasn't until 1836 that the plan was approved and construction began. Although a costly project, the base afforded the country control over the Pacific coast and was essential in action against the Andean peoples to the south.\n\n§RNote: This decision sometimes doesn't actually build the naval base even though it thinks it does (I think it's a base game bug). You have my permission to get your money back via the console and build it yourself.;x
subjugate_yakuts_title;Subjugate the Yakuts;x
subjugate_yakuts_desc;In 1840, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers led by Count Aleksei Boroditzki, stationed in Irkutsk, began a campaign of terror and repression against the Yakuts at the frontier of $COUNTRY$ as part of a royal edict to push through the sparsely populated Siberian wilderness to the Pacific coast. The subjugation of the Yakuts removed the last major obstacle to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ dominance of Siberia and the Pacific coast.;x
subjugate_yakuts_finish_title;Declare Victory over the Yakuts;x
subjugate_yakuts_finish_desc;With their warriors scattered and their greatest settlements under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control, Count Boroditzki offered his liege news of victory over the Yakuts, securing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ dominance over the region.;x
support_bohemian_partisans_title;Support Partisans in Bohemia;x
support_bohemian_partisans_desc;We are clearly too weak now to take back our land by outright force, so we must resort to subterfuge. Let us fund some partians in our former territory and try to convince the new owners that the land isn't worth the trouble.;x
support_latvian_rebels_title;Support Latvian Rebels;x
support_latvian_rebels_desc;We have heard the plight of the Latvians. Long have they struggled and suffered under Finnish rule, and now they have decided to take action. We can support them against the Finns and thereby earn a stalwart ally and weaken their masters in one stroke.;x
suppress_tuscan_resistance_title;Suppress Tuscan Resistance;x
suppress_tuscan_resistance_desc;With our recent conquest of the Duchy of Tuscany, many remain in its former lands who actively seek justice for the collateral damage our troops caused during the war. They seek freedom and revenge. This must be stopped before it gets out of hand. We will make some examples of the populace.;x
swedish_skane_title;Reclaim Skåne;x
swedish_skane_desc;It has been ten years since Skåne was taken from the Swedish crown. With a new king on the throne and a more powerful army than ever, it is time to take it back! Ära vare Sverige!;x

take_ohio_valley_title;Take the Spelewathipi Valley;x

take_upland_south_title;Our Shawnee Claims;x
take_upland_south_desc;With the Cherokee lands under our control, we should push our borders further into the Shawnee territory.;x
take_west_title;Take The Western Great Lakes;x
take_west_desc;The Shawnee west is barely settled territory, and already our pioneers are pushing into this fertile region by the lakeshore. We should stake our claim to these lands.;x
total_war_mex_title;Total War Against Mexika;x
total_war_mex_desc;We must exhort our people to give everything against the European oppressors, or find ourselves crushed for good.;x
treaty_of_brest_title;The Treaty of Brest;x
treaty_of_brest_desc;Ever since our defeat in the Byelorussian War in 1748, we have been waiting for an opportunity to reclaim Brest-Litovsk from Smolensk. At long last, we have our opportunity. With the current situation with Russia, the border is not well-guarded. If we strike quickly, possibly in coordination with the Russians, we may be able to right the wrong done to us a century ago. But that is merely the threat. Let us first see whether Smolensk will return our land peacefully.\n\nHuman Poland only needs State & Government, so Smolensk doesn't HAVE to be at war with Russia.;x
treaty_of_tesepikhav_title;The Treaty of Tesepikhav;x
treaty_of_tesepikhav_desc;By striking deep into the white man's territory and capturing his head city, we can force him to end the war and acknowledge our right to exist!;x
treaty_of_twist_title;The Treaty of Twist;x
treaty_of_twist_desc;With the conclusion of the Brunswick Congress, we are now have the very real possibility to unite the Germans under our banner. The matter of Emden, which the Netherlands seized from Oldenburg in 1827, should be settled, as it will create unnecessary friction between our two countries now that we have inherited Oldenburg's claim. We can propose the town of Twist, on the border, to be a meeting ground for negotiations over the territory.;x
turn_off_meme_decisions_title;Turn Off Meme Decisions;x
turn_off_meme_decisions_desc;You will no longer see them if your country has any, which it probably doesn't. But if you feel like making an AAR, maybe you can come up with a plausible explanation for some of them.;x
turn_off_railroading_title;Turn Off Railroading;x
turn_off_railroading_desc;Select this to disable railroading, which affects the outcomes of some events in the Heirs to Aquitània mod. You can turn it on again whenever you choose.\n\n§RNB: Savs doesn't test non-railroaded, so use it at your own risk. Nothing should crash, but things will be even weirder than HtA already is.;x
turn_on_meme_decisions_title;Turn on Meme Decisions;x
turn_on_meme_decisions_desc;These decisions are ones that are OP or that go against Savs' stick-in-the-mud storytelling ways. But you should play this game how you want. Current list (0.36.60):\n-BYZ:Get cores on Armenia, the Levant, Egypt and the Balkans as Melisurgos, winner of the Roman Civil War.\n-SHC:Get cores on neighbouring countries and then remove their cores;x
turn_on_railroading_title;Turn On Railroading;x

TUS_form_PDN_title;Unite with the Notherners;x
TUS_form_PDN_desc;We won the war against Naples, but only just. It is only a matter of time before they come back to avenge themselves on us, so we had best look for support. In Lombardia there had been talk of an alliance of the states of the Padanian Plain. Perhaps we could propose something similar, for everyone's benefit.;x
unequal_treaty_manchu_title;The Unequal Treaty;x
unequal_treaty_manchu_desc;Manchuria is at a disadvantage. We are in a position to bring them to the negotiating table, and wrangle concessions of both land and reparations-- provided they are willing, of course.;x
unequal_treaty_nanyue_title;The Unequal Treaty;x
unequal_treaty_nanyue_desc;Nanyue is at a disadvantage. We are in a position to bring them to the negotiating table, and wrangle concessions of both land and reparations-- provided they are willing, of course.;x

unification_with_catalonia_desc;Our oppressed and beleaguered brothers to our south are oppressed by their Hispanian overlords! Let us bring them into the fold to secure their freedom!;x
unify_western_med_title;Mare Occidentis Nostrum;x
unify_western_med_desc;We are truly ascendant in the west of the Mediterranean. Its peoples are all our brothers, our cousins, and other long-lost relatives, as evidenced by our similar languages, cultures, customs, and histories. Let the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ eagle spread its wings and bring our far-flung family under its protection, for the benefit of all!\n\n§RNB: You need to own/puppet the owners of Barcelona, Mauguio, Milan, Rome, and Naples - sphereing alone is not enough. If you want to inherit the countries listed in the decision criteria, you must puppet AND sphere them.;x
unite_crowns_BHN_title;Unite the Crowns of Bohemia and Hungary;x
unite_crowns_BHN_desc;In the aftermath of the Hungarian Revolution, the question of the place of Hungary in Bohemia became widely discussed. After deliberation, it was decided that the two crowns should be united in one kingdom proper, thus granting Hungarians recognition as full citizens and full representation in the kingdom. The Crowns of St. Wenceslaus and St. Stephen were joined.;x
unite_the_celts_title;Unite the Ceilts;x
unite_the_celts_desc;Given our ascendancy over our fellow Ceilts and our strength relative to Aengland, we are in a position to unite all Ceilts under one banner so we can create a country without oppression or worry of war.;x
usurp_french_crown_title;Usurp the Crown of France;x
usurp_french_crown_desc;Now that we have occupied the lands of the King and ended the main branch of the House of Sangois, we can usurp the French crown with no one to stop us! Glory to $COUNTRY$!;x
vyazma_march_title;The Vyazma March;x
vyazma_march_desc;After our recent victory, Smolensk is weak: its government is collapsing, what few troops it has are barely paid, and its people are rebelling. They are in no position to repel our troops, truce be damned. Let us dispatch an army immediately down the road across the border to Vyazma, and thence to Smolensk! We can end this in one bold, fell swoop!\n\nNOTE: This will end the chain just the same as winning another war or them falling to rebels, but is probably pretty unlikely to happen. If you don't get the opportunity to take this decision, oh well!;x

window_to_the_west_LAT_title;Window to the West - Latvia;x
window_to_the_west_LAT_desc;Our great country lies so close to the Baltic Sea, yet has no access. Securing a port would allow us to enrich our lands and project our power better against rivals on our western frontier. The newly-independent Latvia is a perfect possibility. Their economy is small and they need aid in modernising. With just a small cash infusion, we could gain important influence that could be used to establish our control over the country, and, most importantly, its coastline.;x
window_to_the_west_LIT_title;Window to the West - Lithuania;x
window_to_the_west_LIT_desc;Our great country lies so close to the Baltic Sea, yet has no access. Securing a port would allow us to enrich our lands and project our power better against rivals on our western frontier. Lithuania, a state long on the fringes of Europe, has somehow avoided much attention from Poland and Finland. Their economy is small and they need aid in modernising. With just a small cash infusion, we could gain important influence that could then be used to establish formal control over the country and, most importantly, its coastline.;x
yoke_the_tatars_title;Yoke the Tatars;x
yoke_the_tatars_desc;While they were a useful ally during the war to unify Great Russia, it is no longer necessary to allow them the autonomy they demand. They are simply no longer necessary as allies, and so it is time to force them to settle for good. Just as the Tatars once shackled us, we shall now shackle them and integrate them into our new empire. They will not go quietly, but they will go.;x
ZAC_inherits_LUZ_title;The Destiny of Luzica;x
ZAC_inherits_LUZ_desc;Beyond the Odra river lies Luzica, the homeland of the Sorbs, the last remnant of the Slavs that once inhabited all the region from Silesia to Denmark. Recent philological work has determined that they, too, are speakers of a language closely related to our own. They have been increasingly marginalized while living in German states, and it is time for us to change that. And we are in a position to do so. Let us welcome them into Zachadia!;x
ZAC_inherits_RUT_title;Our Brothers, the Ruthenians;x
ZAC_inherits_RUT_desc;Though their language may not be quite as close to ours as that of the Silesians or Sorbs, the peoples of Zachadia have had much historical contact with the Ruthenians, which has been to the profit of all our peoples. Now that we find ourselves in a position to exert our influence in the region, we should consider incorporating the rich Ruthenian lands into our great nation. Let all share in its bounty!;x
