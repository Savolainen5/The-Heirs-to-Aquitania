- In events/GreatPowers, the Validator suggests that the node "world_wars_enabled = yes" is not valid. Not sure if correct.
- Many countries build and instantly disband regiments and ships
- Comparing military score to another country doesn't work (not even doing something like "THIS = { military_score = TAG }"). This isn't an HtA bug so much as me not understanding the limitations/capabilities of the game engine in this case
- Calling BYZ into a war against ARM deletes your CB and replaces it with a BYZ acquire state CB on ARM. (Tested with GEO and acquire state CB, see: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-39#post-23231981)
- Something crashes the game when Gidan offers to buy provinces from AQT. Dunno what. Probably something in HtA_SA event or decision files
- There are probably lots of ports that are facing the wrong way, or weird directions. I'll (try to) fix them as I find them.
- The factories which should be in Toledo are actually in Madrid for some reason, though there's no good reason for this as far as I can tell


Unknown crashes log:
- Crashed playing as PRH in late 1853
- Crash in mid-1855, probably related. An event of some sort with an mtth? Doesn't seem to happen in games I start, only in those started by others.
	- Crash as PDN in 1851 or '52 during June-August
	- Crash as FRA in 1855 between 23-26 June - The fact that it is always in this suggests a very short MTTH with a modifier that makes it super short.
